<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>(a) The simplest radio receiver consists of nothing more than an antenna, a diode (germanium), and a pair of headphones. Such a receiver has no frequency selectivity, however, and will receive several of the strongest AM broadcast stations simultaneously. By adding a variable inductor that forms a resonant LC circuit with the antenna capacitance, a usable radio receiver can be constructed that is capable of tuning in to a number of different stations. (The variable capacitor provides additional tunability.) The encoded audio signal within the AM carrier is demodulated by the diode (the diode generates low-frequency [audio] Fourier components that are absent in the transmitted wave). After passing through the diode, only the positive half of the wave remains. This wave contains low-frequency components in addition to components at the frequency of the carrier wave. With the addition of a low-pass filter, only the low-frequency components remain. The frequency response of headphones and of a human ear will effectively act as a low-pass filter. The demodulated signal can be input into an amplifier to drive a speaker—see amplifier circuit. Real radio AM receivers are much more sophisticated than this, using a superheterodyne design scheme.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>(b) A radio transmitter consists of an RF oscillator, one or more amplifier stages, and a modulator. In the simple FM transmitter shown here, the LC resonant filter sets the amplifier oscillatory frequency—the variable capacitor allows for adjustability. Audio signals that enter will be frequency-modulated into the carrier and radiated as radio waves. An FM radio receiver should be able to pick up the circuit signal. A homemade inductor can be made by tightly winding 10 turns of 22-gauge wire around a ¼-in form.</span></span></span></div>

<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">PCB Design Tips</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Avoid slit apertures in PCB layout, such as a ground plane that is divided into two parts. Regions of high impedance are sources of high EMI, so use wide tracks for power lines on the trace sides for increased conduction. Make signal tracks stripline (ground planes above and below) and include ground plane and power plane whenever possible. Keep HF and RF tracks short and lay out the HF tracks first—see (<a href="#filepos1427834">a</a>). In <a href="#filepos1427834">Fig. 3.95</a>. Avoid track stubs, since they cause reflections and harmonics—see (<a href="#filepos1427834">b</a>). Use a surrounding guard ring and ground fill where possible on sensitive components and terminations. A guard ring around trace layers reduces emission out of board. Likewise, connect to ground only at a single point—see (<a href="#filepos1427834">e</a>). Keep separate power planes over a common ground to reduce system noise and power coupling—see (<a href="#filepos1427834">d</a>). Keep track runs as orthogonal as possible between adjacent layers—see (<a href="#filepos1427834">c</a>). Also avoid loop track that acts as a receiving or radiating antenna. Avoid floating conductor areas, since they act as EMI radiators. Connect them to a ground plane otherwise.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Power Supply</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Avoid loops in supply lines, as shown in (<a href="#filepos1427834">h</a>). Also decouple supply lines at local boundaries—see (<a href="#filepos1427834">i</a>). Position high-speed circuits closest to the power supply, while placing the slowest section farthest away to reduce power plane transients—see (<a href="#filepos1427834">g</a>). When possible, isolate individual systems on both power supply and signal lines—see (<a href="#filepos1427834">j</a>).</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Filtering Components</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Position biasing and pull-up/down components close to driver/bias points. Make use of common-mode chokes between current-carrying and signal lines to increase coupling and eliminate stray fields—see (<a href="#filepos1427834">k</a>). Place decoupling capacitors close to chip supply lines to reduce component noise and power line transients—see (<a href="#filepos1427834">l</a>).</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>A basic transformer is a two-port (four-terminal) device capable of transforming an ac input voltage into a higher or lower ac output voltage. Transformers are not designed to raise or lower dc voltages, however, since the conversion mechanism relies on a changing magnetic field generated by a changing current. A typical transformer consists of two or more insulated wire coils that share a common laminated iron core. One of the coils is called the primary (containing <span class="italic">N<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">P</sub></span></small></span> turns), while the other coil is called the secondary (containing <span class="italic">N<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">S</sub></span></small></span> turns). A simplistic representation of a transformer is shown in <a href="#filepos1432630">Fig. 3.96</a>, along with its schematic symbol.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>When an ac voltage is applied across the primary coil of the transformer, an alternating magnetic flux Φ<sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><span class="italic">M</span></span></small></sub> = ∫(<span class="italic">V<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">IN</sub></span></small></span>/<span class="italic">N<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">p</sub></span></small></span>)<span class="italic">dt</span> emanates from the primary, propagates through the iron-laminated core, and passes through the secondary coil. (The iron core increases the inductance, and the laminations decrease power-consuming eddy currents.) According to Faraday’s law of induction, the changing magnetic flux induces a voltage of <span class="italic">V<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">S</sub></span></small></span> = <span class="italic">N<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">S</sub></span></small>d</span>Φ<sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><span class="italic">M</span></span></small></sub>/<span class="italic">dt</span>, assuming there is perfect magnetic flux coupling (coefficient of coupling <span class="italic">k</span> = 1). Combining the primary flux equation with the secondary induced voltage equation results in the following useful expression:</span></div>
<div class="calibre19"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00940.jpg" class="calibre898"/></span></div>
<div id="filepos1434176" class="calibre491"><span>(3.1) Transformer voltage ratio</span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>
<div class="calibre6"><span>This equation says that if the number of turns in the primary coil is larger than the number of turns in the secondary coil, the secondary voltage will be smaller than the primary voltage. Conversely, if the number of turns in the primary coil is less than the number of turns in the secondary, the secondary voltage will be larger than the primary.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>When a source voltage is applied across a transformer’s primary terminals while the secondary terminals are open-circuited (see <a href="#filepos1436112">Fig. 3.97</a>), the source treats the transformer as if it were a simple inductor with an impedance of <span class="italic">Z<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">P</sub></span></small></span> = <span class="italic">j</span>ω<span class="italic">L</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">P</sub></span></small> = ω<span class="italic">L</span> ∠ 90°, where <span class="italic">L<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">P</sub></span></small></span> represents the inductance of the primary coil. This means that the primary current will lag the voltage (source voltage) by 90°, and the primary current will be equal to <span class="italic">V<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">P</sub></span></small>/Z<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">P</sub></span></small></span>, according to Ohm’s law.

<div class="calibre26"><span>When there is no load attached to the secondary of a transformer, the current within the primary is called the magnetizing current of the transformer. An ideal transformer, with no internal losses, would consume no power, since the current through the primary inductor would be 90° out of phase with the voltage (in <span class="italic">P</span> = <span class="italic">IV</span>, <span class="italic">I</span> is imaginary and the “power” is imaginary or reactive). With no load in the secondary, the only losses in the transformer are associated with those losses in the iron core and losses within the primary coil wire itself.</span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Example 1:</span></span> A transformer has a primary of 200 turns and a secondary of 1200 turns. If a 120 VAC is applied to the primary, what voltage appears across the secondary?</span></div>

<div class="calibre6"><span>This is an example of a step-up transformer, since the secondary voltage is higher than the primary voltage.</span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Example 2:</span></span> Using the same transformer from Example 1, flip it around so the secondary now acts as the primary. What will be the new secondary voltage?</span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Answer:</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre19"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00943.jpg" class="calibre901"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span>This is an example of a step-down transformer, since the secondary voltage is lower than the primary voltage.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>As you can see from the previous example, either winding of a transformer can be used as the primary, provided the windings have enough turns (enough inductance) to induce a voltage equal to the applied voltage without requiring an excessive current. The windings must also have insulation with a voltage rating sufficient for the voltage present.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Now let’s take a look at what happens when you attach a load to the secondary, as shown in <a href="#filepos1439212">Fig. 3.98</a>.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1439212" class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00944.jpg" class="calibre110"/></span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>When a load is attached to the secondary, the secondary current sets up a magnetic field that opposes the field set up by the primary current. For the induced voltage in the primary to equal the applied voltage, the original field must be maintained. The primary must draw enough additional current to set up a field exactly equal and opposite to the field set up by the secondary current. At this point, for practical purposes, we assume that the entire primary current is a result of the secondary load. (This is close to true, since the magnetizing current will be very small in comparison with the primary load current at rated power output.)</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Current Ratio</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>To figure out the relationship between the primary and secondary currents, consider that an ideal transformer is 100 percent efficient (real transformers are around 65 to 99 percent efficient, depending on make), and then infer that all the power dissipated by the load in the secondary will be equal to the power supplied by the primary source. With the help of the generalized power law, we get:</span></div>
<div class="calibre19"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00945.jpg" class="calibre902"/></span></div>

<div id="filepos1441740" class="calibre491"><span>(3.2) Ideal transformer current ratio</span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>
<div class="calibre6"><span><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Example 3:</span></span> A transformer with a primary of 180 turns and a secondary with 1260 turns is delivering 0.10 A to a load. What is the primary current?</span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Answer:</span></span> Rearranging <a href="#filepos1441740">Eq. 3.2</a> and solving for the primary current:</span></div>
<div class="calibre19"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00948.jpg" class="calibre905"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre30"><span>Notice from the previous example that even though the secondary voltage is larger than the primary voltage, the secondary current is smaller than the primary current. The secondary current in an ideal transformer is 180° out of phase with the primary current, since the field in the secondary just offsets the field in the primary. The phase relationship between the currents in the windings holds true no matter what the phase difference between the current and the voltage of the secondary. In fact, the phase difference, if any, between voltage and current in the secondary will be reflected back to the primary as an identical phase difference. Note that phase, however, can be selected according to how you pull the secondary out—see the following note.</span></div>

<div class="calibre1"><span><a></a><span class="bold">NOTE ABOUT PHASE</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>By now you may be a bit annoyed with the notion of phase. For example, to say that the primary voltage is out of phase with the secondary by 180° is smack in the phase to relativity. Couldn’t you simply wind the secondary winding in a different direction or, more easily, simply reverse the secondary leads to get an output that is within phase? The answer is yes. It is a relativity game with the transformer pins. <a href="#filepos1445518">Figure 3.99</a> shows two transformers that are identical in every way except for the winding direction of the secondary. The winding A arrangement, when tested with a common ground and oscilloscope, yields in-phase voltages, while the winding in B yields voltage and currents that are 180° out of phase with the primary. To avoid confusion, a convention is used to keep track of the relative polarity between the leads. This convention makes use of what are called phase dots, which are a pair of dots: one placed on the primary side; the other placed on the secondary side. The similar placement of these dots next to the top ends of the primary and secondary windings tells you that whatever instantaneous voltage polarity is seen across the primary winding will be the same as that across the secondary winding. In other words, the phase shift from primary to secondary will be zero degrees. On the other hand, if dots on each winding of the transformer do not match up, the phase shift is 180° between primary and secondary. Of course, the dot convention only tells you which end of each winding is which, relative to the other winding(s). If you want to reverse the phase relationship, all you have to do is swap the winding connections.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>A moment ago, when deriving the transformer current equation, we assumed that the transfer of power from primary to secondary was 100 percent efficient. However, it is important to realize that there is always some power loss in the resistance of the coils and in the iron core of the transformer. This means that the power taken from the source is greater than the power used in the secondary. This can be stated by the following expression:</span></div>

<div class="calibre6"><span>Transformers are typically designed to have highest efficiency at the manufacturer’s rated outputs. Above or below the rated output, the efficiency drops. The amount of power a transformer can handle depends on its own losses (heating of wire and core, etc.). Exceeding the rated power of a transformer can lead to wire meltdown or insulation breakdown. Even when the load is purely reactive, the transformer will still be generating heat loss due to internal resistance of the coils and losses in the core. For this reason, manufacturers also specify a maximum volt-amp rating, or VA-rating, that should not be exceeded.</span></div>

<div class="calibre6"><span>If the load impedance in the secondary increases, the impedance looking into the primary (from the source’s point of view) will also increase in a manner that is proportional to the ratio of the turns squared.</span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">Example 5:</span></span> A transformer has a primary with 500 turns and a secondary with 1000 turns. What is the primary impedance if a 2000-Ω load impedance is attached to the secondary?</span></div>

<div class="calibre19"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00954.jpg" class="calibre910"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span>As you can see, by selecting the proper turns ratio, the impedance of a fixed load can be transformed to any desired value (ideally). If transformer losses can be neglected, the transformed (reflected) impedance has the same phase angle as the actual load impedance. Hence, if the load is purely resistive, the load presented by the primary to the power source will also be pure resistance. If the load impedance is complex (e.g., inductance and capacitance are thrown in so that load current and voltage are out of phase with each other), then the primary voltage and current will show the same phase angle.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>In electronics, there are many instances where circuits require a specific load resistance (or impedance) for optimum performance. The impedance of the actual load dissipating power may differ widely from the impedance of the source. In this case, a transformer can be used to change the actual load into an impedance of desired value. This is referred to as impedance matching. We can rearrange <a href="#filepos1449586">Eq. 3.4</a> and get:</span></div>

<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Transformer Gear Analogy</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>It is often helpful to think of transformers as gearboxes. For example, in the gearbox analogy in <a href="#filepos1456826">Fig. 3.102</a>, the primary winding is analogous to the input shaft (where the motor is attached) and the secondary winding is analogous to the output shaft. Current is equivalent to shaft speed (rmp) and voltage is equivalent to torque. In a gearbox, mechanical power (speed multiplied by torque) is constant (neglecting losses) and is equivalent to electrical power (voltage times current), which is also constant. The gear ratio is equivalent to the transformer step-up or step-down ratio. A step-up transformer acts like a reduction gear (in which mechanical power is transferred from a small, rapidly rotating gear to a large, slowly rotating gear): it trades current (speed) for voltage (torque), by transferring power from a primary coil to a secondary coil having more turns. A step-down transformer acts similarly to a multiplier gear (in which mechanical power is transferred from a large gear to a small gear): it trades voltage (torque) for current (speed), by transferring power from a primary coil to a secondary coil having fewer turns.</span></div>

<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Center-Tap Transformers</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Rarely do you see transformers in the real world with just four leads—two for the primary and two for the secondary. Many commercial transformers employ center taps. A center tap is simply an electrical connection that is made somewhere between the two ends of a transformer winding. By using a center tap, it is possible to utilize only a fraction of the winding voltage. For example, in <a href="#filepos1458403">Fig. 3.103</a>, a transformer’s secondary is center-tapped midway between its winding, yielding two output voltages <span class="italic">V</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><span class="italic">S</span>1</span></small></sub> and <span class="italic">V</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><span class="italic">S</span>2</span></small></sub>. If we place a ground reference on the center tap (it is treated now as a common), we see the voltages in terms of phase, as shown in the example circuit in <a href="#filepos1458403">Fig. 3.103</a>. In this case, the two secondary voltages are equal because we assumed that the number of turns on either end of the center tap were the same. In general, the secondary voltages are determined by the turns ratio.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1458403" class="calibre3"><span><a></a><img alt="image" src="images/00959.jpg" class="calibre276"/></span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>Center taps can be placed on both the primary side and the secondary side, with multiple taps on either side. For example, a typical power transformer has several secondary windings, each providing a different voltage. <a href="#filepos1459717">Figure 3.104</a> shows a schematic of a typical power supply transformer. It is possible to join pins with a jumper to get the desired voltage ratios across other pins. Manufacturers will provide you with the voltages between the various tap points, usually specifying CT as the center-tap voltage. Center taps provide flexibility in design and allow varying outputs, which you implement by incorporating switches, for example. We’ll see how a center-tap transformer is used to split incoming 240 VAC for the main into two 120-VAC legs within the circuit breaker of your house, and we’ll also discover how full-wave center-tap rectifier circuits are used in building dc power supplies.</span></div>

<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Real Transformer Characteristics</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span><a></a>A perfect or ideal transformer has a primary-to-secondary coupling coefficient of 1. This means that both coils link with all the magnetic flux lines, so that the voltage induced per turn is the same for both coils. This also means that the induced voltage per turn is the same for both primary and secondary coils. Iron core transformers operating at low frequencies come close to being ideal. However, due to various imperfections, such as eddy current, hysteresis losses, internal coil resistance, and skin effects at higher frequencies, this isn’t quite true.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>In real transformers, not all of the magnetic flux is common to both windings. Flux not associated with linkage is referred to as <span class="italic">leakage flux</span> and is responsible for a voltage of self-induction. There are small amounts of leakage inductance associated with both windings of a transformer. Leakage inductance acts in exactly the same manner as an equivalent amount of ordinary inductance inserted in series with the circuit. The reactance associated with leakage inductance is referred to as <span class="italic">leakage reactance</span>, which varies with transformer build and frequency. <a href="#filepos1461944">Figure 3.105</a> shows a real-life model of a transformer including leakage reactances for both primary and secondary coils, namely, <span class="italic">X</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><span class="italic">L</span>1</span></small></sub> and <span class="italic">X</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><span class="italic">L</span>2</span></small></sub>. When current flows through a leakage reactance, there is an associated voltage drop. The voltage drop becomes greater with increasing current and increases as more power is taken from the secondary.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1461944" class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00961.jpg" class="calibre103"/></span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>The internal resistances of a transformer’s windings <span class="italic">R</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">1</sub></span></small> and <span class="italic">R</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">2</sub></span></small> also result in voltage drop when there is current flow. Although these voltage drops are not in phase with those caused by leakage reactance, together they result in a lower secondary voltage under load than is indicated by the transformer turns ratio formula.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Another nonideal characteristic of transformers is stray capacitance. An electric field exists between any two points having a different voltage. When current flows through a coil, each turn has a slightly different voltage than its adjacent turns. This results in capacitance between turns and is modeled by <span class="italic">C</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">1</sub></span></small> and <span class="italic">C</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">2</sub></span></small> in <a href="#filepos1461944">Fig. 3.105</a>. A mutual capacitance <span class="italic">C<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">M</sub></span></small></span> also exists between the primary and secondary windings for the same reason. It is also possible for transformer windings to exhibit capacitance relative to nearby metal, such as a chassis, shield, or even the core itself.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Stray capacitance tends to have little influence in power and audio transformers, but becomes influential as the frequencies increase. In RF applications where transformers are used, the stray capacitance can resonate with either the leakage reactance or, at lower frequencies, the winding reactances, especially under very light or zero-ohm loads. In the frequency region around resonance, transformers do not exhibit behavior as described by the previous transformer equations.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>Iron core transformers also experience losses with hysteresis and eddy current, as was discussed in <a href="CR%21QKYKJ7KY3158K36EJE0G9AYNF2ZW_split_000.html#filepos259228">Sec. 2.24</a>. These losses, which add to the required magnetizing current, are equivalent to adding a resistance in parallel to <span class="italic">R</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">1</sub></span></small> in <a href="#filepos1461944">Fig. 3.105</a>.</span></div>

<div class="calibre1"><span><span class="bold">TRANSFORMER PRECAUTIONS</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span>There are three basic rules to observe when using a transformer. First, never apply a voltage that is greatly in excess of the transformer winding ratings. Second, never allow a significant direct current to flow through any winding not designed to handle it. Third, don’t operate the transformer at a frequency outside the range specified by the manufacturer. Applying a voltage of, say, 120 VAC to a secondary in hopes of achieving 1200 VAC at the primary is a bad idea—expect smoke and combustion, accompanied by insulation failure. Similar results can be expected with excessive dc current through the primary. In terms of frequency, a 60-Hz transformer driven at 20 Hz will draw too much magnetizing current and will run dangerously hot.</span></div>

<div class="calibre1"><span class="calibre17"><span><span class="bold">Cores</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Transformers used for power and audio frequencies have cores made of many thin laminations of silicon steel. The laminations reduce eddy currents, as discussed in <a href="CR%21QKYKJ7KY3158K36EJE0G9AYNF2ZW_split_000.html#filepos259228">Sec. 2.24</a>. A typical laminated core is made from E-shaped and I-shaped pieces, sandwiched together, as shown in <a href="#filepos1466685">Fig. 3.106</a>. Transformers made from these cores are therefore often referred to as EI transformers.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1466685" class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00962.jpg" class="calibre285"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 3.106</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>Two common core shapes in use are shown in <a href="#filepos1466685">Fig. 3.106</a>. In the shell construction, both the primary and the secondary windings are wound around the same inner leg, while in the core construction, primary and secondary windings are wound on separate legs. The core construction is often implemented to minimize capacitive effects between primary and secondary windings, or when one winding is to be operated at very high voltage. The size, shape, and type of core material, as well as the frequency range, influence the required number of turns in each winding. In most transformers, the coils are wound in layers, with a sheet of special paper insulation placed between each layer. A thicker insulation is used between adjacent coils and between the core and the first coil.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Powdered iron cores, with their low eddy current characteristics, are used in transformers that operate above mains frequencies (60 Hz) up to several kilohertz. These cores have a very high permeability and thus provide decent stepping capability for their size. Transformers that are used in even higher-frequency applications, such as RF, often contain cores made from nonconductive magnetic ceramic materials or ferrites.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>A common core shape for powdered iron and ferrite core transformers is the toroid, as shown in <a href="#filepos1469239">Fig. 3.107a</a>. The closed ring shape of the toroid eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an EI core. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. Ferrite cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to a megahertz. In general, toroidal transformers are more efficient (around 95 percent) than cheaper laminated EI transformers; they are more compact (about half the size), weigh less (about half), have less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio applications), and have lower off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits).</span></div>

<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Shielding</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>To eliminate mutual capacitance between windings within a transformer, an electrostatic shield is often placed between the windings. Some transformers may incorporate a magnetic shield, as shown in <a href="#filepos1469239">Fig. 3.107b</a>. The magnetic shield helps prevent outside magnetic fields (interference) from inducing currents within the inner windings. The shield also helps prevent the transformer from becoming an interference radiator itself.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><a></a><span class="bold">Windings</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>For small-power and signal transformers, the windings are made from solid wire copper, insulated typically with enamel; sometimes additional insulation is used for safety. Larger-power transformers may be wound with copper or aluminum wire, or even strip conductors for very heavy current; in some cases multistrand conductors are used to reduce skin effect losses. High-frequency transformers operating in the kilohertz range often have windings made of Litz wire to minimize skin effects. For signal transformers, the windings may be arranged in a way to minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance in order to improve high-frequency response.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>An autotransformer is similar to a standard transformer; however, it uses only one single coil and a center tap (or taps) to make primary and secondary connections. See <a href="#filepos1471815">Fig. 3.108</a>. As with standard transformers, autotransformers can be used to step up or step down voltages, as well as match impedances; however, they will not provide electrical isolation like a standard transformer, since their primary and secondary are on the same coil—there is no electrical isolation between the two coils.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1471815" class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00964.jpg" class="calibre276"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 3.108</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Although an autotransformer has only one winding, the laws of induction that were used with a standard transformer to step up and step down voltage can be applied just as well. This also applies to principles of current and impedance as a function of the number of winding turns. In <a href="#filepos1471815">Fig. 3.108</a>, the current in the common winding is the difference between the line current (primary current) and the load current (secondary current), since these currents are out of phase. Hence, if the line and load currents are nearly equal, the common section of the winding may be wound with comparatively small wire. The line and load currents will be equal only when the primary (line) and secondary (load) voltages are close in magnitude.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Autotransformers are often used in impedance-matching applications. They are also frequently used for boosting or reducing the power-line voltage by relatively small amounts. <a href="#filepos1471815">Figure 3.108</a> shows a switch-stepped autotransformer whose output voltage can be set to any number of values determined by the switch contact position.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>A variable transformer or Variac (commercial name) is similar to the switch-stepped autotransformer in <a href="#filepos1471815">Fig. 3.108</a>; however, it has a continuous wiper action along a circular coil, as shown in <a href="#filepos1473966">Fig. 3.109</a>. A Variac acts like an adjustable ac voltage source. Its primary is connected to the hot and neutral of the 120-V line voltage, while the secondary leads consist of the neutral and an adjustable wiper that moves along the single core winding.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1473966" class="calibre3"><span><a></a><img alt="image" src="images/00965.jpg" class="calibre915"/></span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>Being able to adjust the line voltage is a very useful trick when troubleshooting line-power equipment, where the fuse instantly blows at normal line voltage. Even without a fuse blowing, troubleshooting at around 85 V may reduce the fault current.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>It is important to note that a Variac by itself does not provide isolation protection like a standard transformer, since the primary and secondary shared a common winding. It is therefore important, if you plan to work on ungrounded, “hot chassis” equipment, that you place an isolation transformer before the Variac—never after it. If you don’t, shock hazards await. <a href="#filepos1473966">Figure 3.109c</a> shows a schematic of such an arrangement. It includes a switch and fuse protection, as well as current and voltage meters, all of which create an adjustable, fully isolated ac power source.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>To avoid the hassle of cascading a Variac and isolation transformer together, simply get an ac power supply that houses both elements together in one package—see <a href="#filepos1473966">Fig. 3.109d</a>.</span></div>

It is possible to accomplish the same effect by using a normal (isolated) transformer with just the right primary/secondary turns ratio. There is still another alternative—use a step-down configuration with secondary winding connected in a series-aiding (“boosting”) or series-opposing (“bucking”) configuration, as shown in <a href="#filepos1476671">Fig. 3.110</a>.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>In the boosting configuration, the secondary coil’s polarity is oriented so that its voltage directly adds to the primary voltage. In the bucking configuration, the secondary coil’s polarity is oriented so that its voltage directly subtracts from the primary voltage. An autotransformer does the same job as the boosting and bucking functions displayed here, but using only a single winding, making it cheaper and lighter to manufacture.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>Transformers perform an important role in isolating one circuit from another. <a href="#filepos1478476">Figure 3.111</a> shows an example application that uses a transformer to isolate a load connected to an ac outlet. In this application, there is no need to step up or step down the voltage, so the transformer has a 1:1 winding ratio. Such a transformer is referred to as an <span class="italic">isolation transformer</span>. In <a href="#filepos1478476">Fig. 3.111</a>, a mains isolation transformer is used to isolate a load from the source, as well as provide ground fault protection. An isolation transformer should be used whenever you work on nongrounded equipment, with no input isolation, such as switch-mode power supplies.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>In your home wiring, the neutral (white) and the ground (green) connections are tied together at the main junction box, so they are basically at the same potential—0 V, or earth ground. If you accidentally touch the hot wire while being in contact with a grounded object, current will pass through your body and give you a potentially fatal shock. With an isolation transformer, the secondary winding leads act as a 120-V source and return, similar to the mains’ hot and neutral, but with an important difference. Neither the secondary source nor return runs are tied to earth ground! This means that if you touch the secondary source or return while being in contact with a grounded object, no current will flow through your body. Current only wants to pass between the secondary source and return runs. (Note that all transformers provide isolation, not just line isolation transformers. Therefore, equipment with input power transformers already have basic isolation protection built in. Isolation transformers used for laboratory work are explained in greater detail in <a href="CR%21QKYKJ7KY3158K36EJE0G9AYNF2ZW_split_013.html#filepos2237731">Sec. 7.5.12</a>.)</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Isolation transformers are also typically constructed with two isolated Faraday shields between the primary and secondary windings. The use of the two shields diverts high-frequency noise, which would normally be coupled across the transformer to ground. Increasing the separation between the two Faraday shields minimizes the capacitance between the two and, hence, the coupling of noise between the two. Therefore, the isolation transformer acts to clean up line power noise before being delivered to a circuit.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>These transformers are used primarily to reduce line voltage. They come in a variety of different shapes, sizes, and primary and secondary winding ratios. They often come with taps and multiple secondary windings. Color-coded wires are frequently used to indicate primary and secondary leads (e.g., black wires for primary, green for secondary, and yellow for tap lead is one possibility). Other transformers use pins for primary, secondary, and tapped leads, allowing them to be mounted on a PC board. You can also find transformers in wall-mount packages that plug directly into an ac outlet, with screw-in terminals as secondary and tapped leads.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Audio transformers are used primarily to match impedances between audio devices (e.g., between microphone and amplifier or amplifier and speaker), though they can be implemented in other ways as well. They work best at audio frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Outside this range they will reduce or block signals. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and typically contain a center tap in both the primary and secondary windings. Some come with color-coded wires to specify leads, while other audio transformers have pinlike terminals that can be mounted on PC boards. Spec tables provide dc resistance values for primary and secondary windings to help you select the appropriate transformer for the particular matching application. Besides performing simple impedance matching, audio transformers can be used to step up or step down a signal voltage, convert a circuit from unbalanced to balanced and vice versa, block dc current in a circuit while allowing ac current to flow, and provide basic isolation between one device and another. Note that audio transformers have a maximum input level that cannot be exceeded without causing distortion. Also, audio transformers cannot step up a signal by more than about 25 dB when used in typical audio circuits. Because of this, an audio transformer cannot be substituted for a microphone preamp. If more than 25 dB of gain is required, an active preamp must be used instead of a transformer.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Air core transformers are special devices used in radio-frequency circuits. (They are used for RF coupling, such as antenna tuning and impedance matching.) Unlike steel or ferrite core transformers, the core is made from a nonmagnetic form, usually a hollow tube of plastic. The degree of coupling between windings in an air core transformer is much less than that of a steel core transformer; however, there are no losses associated with eddy currents, hysteresis, saturation, and so on, as is the case with magnetic cores. This becomes critically important in RF applications—at high frequencies, steel core transformers experience significant losses. Toroidal air core transformers aren’t common nowadays, except in VHF (very high frequency) work. Today, special coupling networks and RF powdered-iron and ferrite toroids have generally replaced air cores, except in situations where the circuit handles very high power or the coils must be very temperature stable.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>There are three principal uses for transformers: to transform voltages and currents from one level to another, to physically isolate the primary circuit from the secondary, and to transform circuit impedances from one level to another. Here are some examples in action.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1485564" class="calibre3"><span><a></a><img alt="image" src="images/00971.jpg" class="calibre919"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Toroidal ferrite and powdered-iron transformers are used from a few hundred hertz well into the UHF spectrum. The principal advantage of this type of core is self-shielding and low losses due to eddy currents. The permeability/size ratio is also very large, making them compact devices requiring fewer coil turns than traditional transformers. The most common ferrite toroid transformer is the conventional broadband transformer. Broadband transformers provide dc isolation between the primary and secondary circuits. The primary of a step-down impedance transformer is wound to occupy the entire core, with the secondary wound over the primary, as shown in <a href="#filepos1485564">Fig. 3.115</a>. This style of transformer is frequently used in impedance matching. In standard broadcast radio receivers, these transformers operate in a frequency range from 530 to 1550 kHz. In shortwave receivers, RF transformers are subjected to frequencies up to about 20 MHz; in radar, it approaches upward of 200 MHz.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Pulse transformers are special transformers optimized for transmitting rectangular electrical pulses—ones with fast rise and fall times and constant amplitude. A small signal transformer is a small version of a pulse transformer. These devices are used in digital logic and telecom circuits, often for matching logic drivers to transmission lines. Medium-size power versions are used in power-control circuits such as camera flash controllers, while larger-power versions are used in electrical power distribution to interface low-voltage control circuitry with high-voltage power semiconductive gates, such as TRIACs, IGBTs, thyristors, and MOSFETs. Special high-voltage pulse transformers are used to generate high-power pulses for radar, particle accelerators, or other pulsed power applications.<br class="calibre16"/>    To minimize pulse shape distortion, a pulse transformer requires very low leakage inductance and distributed capacitance, and a high open-circuit inductance. Low coupling capacitance is also important in power-pulse transformer applications to protect circuitry on the primary side from high-power transients created by load.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Current transformers are special devices used primarily to measure larger currents that would be too dangerous to measure with an ammeter. They are designed to provide a current in their secondary that is proportional to the current flowing in the primary. A typical current transformer resembles a toroidal core inductor with many secondary windings. The primary coil consists of simply passing a single cable-to-be-measured (insulated) through the center of the toroid. The output current through the secondary is many times smaller than the actual current through the cable (primary). These transformers are specified by their input and output current ratio (400:5, 2000:5, etc.). Current transformers designed for electrical supply applications are designed to drive 5-A (full-scale) meters. There are also wideband current transformers used to measure high-frequency waveforms and pulsed currents.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

A center-tap pole transformer is used to step down the line voltage to 240 V. The tap then acts to break this voltage up into 120-V portions. Small appliances, such as TVs, lights, and hair dryers can use either the top line and the neutral line or the bottom line and the neutral line. (The neutral is grounded to a ground rod through a link between neutral and ground buses in the breaker box.) Larger appliances, such as stoves, refrigerators, and clothes dryers often make use of the 240-V terminals and often use the neutral terminal as well.

The lamps in this case don’t care if the voltage is ac since the frequency (60 Hz) is too fast for there to be any noticeable variation in luminous output. Most commercial transformers used for landscape wiring, or for driving solenoid-powered sprinkler systems, will come with multiple outputs. This transformer provides 12-V, 24-V, and 14-V outputs. The 14-V output may be used to drive 12-V lamps if there is an anticipated voltage drop along long cable runs; the 24-V output may be used to drive 24-V devices. Note that the total load should not consume more power than the transformer’s rated output capacity. For example, this 100-W transformer should not be used to drive more than, say, ten 10-watt lamps or five 20-watt lamps. Exceeding this will result in lamp dimming.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>(a) Maximum power is transferred to a load if the load impedance is equal to the Thevenin impedance of the network supplying power. To supply maximum power transfer from the audio amplifier with an output impedance of 500 Ω to an 8-Ω speaker, we must properly match the load impedance with that of the output impedance (or Thevenin impedance) of the source. If we were not to match impedance and attempt to drive the 8-Ω speaker directly, the impedance mismatch would result in very poor (low peak power) performance. Also, the amplifier would dissipate considerable power in the form of heat as it tries to drive the low-impedance speaker.<br class="calibre16"/>     When going from a high-impedance (high-voltage, low-current) source to a low-impedance (low-voltage, high-current) load, we need to use a step-down transformer. To determine the turns ratio required, we refer back to Eq. 5:</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>In other words, the required winding ratio is 7.906:1. With such a transformer in place, the speaker will load the amplifier to just the right degree, drawing power at the correct voltage and current levels for the most efficient power transfer to load.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>(b) Note that most transistor or IC hi-fi amplifier and speaker systems have amplifiers with output impedances much lower than the speaker impedance. A typical speaker impedance is 8 Ω, for example, but most hi-fi amplifiers have an output impedance of 0.1 Ω or less. This not only ensures that most of the audio energy is transferred to the speaker, but also that the amplifier’s low output impedance provides good electrical damping for the speaker’s moving voice coil—giving higher fidelity.<br class="calibre16"/>     Older valve amplifiers needed a different form of impedance matching, because output valves generally had fairly fixed and relatively high output impedance so they couldn’t deliver audio energy efficiently into the low load impedance of a typical speaker. So an output transformer had to be used to produce a closer impedance match. The transformer stepped up the impedance of the speaker, so that it gave the output valve an effective load of a few thousand ohms; this was at least comparable to the valve’s own output impedance, so only a small amount of energy was wasted as heat in the valve.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00007.jpg" class="calibre36"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Fuses and circuit breakers are devices designed to protect circuits from excessive current flows, which are often a result of large currents that result from shorts or sudden power surges. A fuse contains a narrow strip of metal that is designed to melt when current flow exceeds its current rating, thereby interrupting power to the circuit. Once a fuse blows (wire melts), it must be replaced with a new one. A circuit breaker is a mechanical device that can be reset after it “blows.” It contains a spring-loaded contact that is latched into position against another contact. When the current flow exceeds a breaker’s current rating, a bimetallic strip heats up and bends. As the strip bends, it “trips” the latch, and the spring pulls the contacts apart. To reset the breaker, a button or rockerlike switch is pressed to compress the spring and reset the latch.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00988.jpg" class="calibre935"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 3.123</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>In homes, fuses/circuit breakers are used to prevent the wires within the walls from melting under excessive current flow (typically upwards of 15 A); they are not designed to protect devices, such as dc power supplies, oscilloscopes, and other line-powered devices, from damage. For example, if an important current-limiting component within a test instrument (powered from the main line) shorts out, or if it is connected to an extremely large test current, the circuit within the device may be flooded with, say, 10 A instead of 0.1 A. According to <span class="italic">P</span> = <span class="italic">I</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre29">2</sup></span></small><span class="italic">R</span>, the increase in wattage will be 10,000 times larger, and as a result, the components within the circuit will fry. As the circuit is melting away, no help will come from the main 15-A breaker—the surge in current through the device may be large, but not large enough to trip the breaker. For this reason, it is essential that each individual device contain its own properly rated fuse.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Fuses come in <span class="italic">fast-action</span> (quick-blow) and <span class="italic">time-lag</span> (slow-blow) types. A fast-acting fuse will turn off with just a brief surge in current, whereas a time-lag fuse will take a while longer (a second or so). Time-lag fuses are used in circuits that have large turn-on currents, such as motor circuits, and other inductive-type circuits.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>In practice, a fuse’s current rating should be around 50 percent larger than the expected nominal current rating. The additional leeway allows for unexpected, slight variations in current and also provides compensation for fuses whose current ratings decrease as they age.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Fuses and breakers that are used with 120-V ac line power must be placed in the hot line (black wire in the United States) and must be placed before the device they are designed to protect. If a fuse or circuit breaker is placed in the neutral line (white wire), the full line-voltage will be present at the input, even if the fuse/circuit breaker blows. Circuit breakers that are used to protect 240-V ac appliances (e.g., stoves, clothes dryers) have fuses on all three input wires (both the hot wires and the neutral wire) (see <a href="#filepos1504290">Fig. 3.124</a>).

Cartridge fuses are wrapped in paper, like shotgun shells, and come with either ferrule or knife-blade contacts. Ferrule-contact fuses protect from up to 60 A, while knife-blade contact fuses are rated at 60 A or higher.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>Materials are classified by their ability to conduct electricity. Substances that easily pass an electric current, such as silver and copper, are referred to as <span class="italic">conductors</span>. Materials that have a difficult time passing an electric current, such as rubber, glass, and Teflon, are called <span class="italic">insulators</span>. There is a third category of material whose conductivity lies between those of conductors and insulators. This third category of material is referred to as a <span class="italic">semiconductor</span>. A semiconductor has a kind of neutral conductivity when taken as a group. Technically speaking, semiconductors are defined as those materials that have a conductivity σ in the range between 10<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre29">−7</sup></span></small> and 10<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre29">3</sup></span></small> mho/cm (see <a href="#filepos1510203">Fig. 4.2</a>). Some semiconductors are pure-elemental structures (e.g., silicon, germanium), others are alloys (e.g., nichrome, brass), and still others are liquids.</span></div>

<div class="calibre3"><span><a></a><span class="bold">Silicon</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Silicon is the most important semiconductor used in building electrical devices. Other materials such as germanium and selenium are sometimes used, too, but they are less popular. In pure form, silicon has a unique atomic structure with very important properties useful in making electrical devices.</span></div>

<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 4.3</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Silicon is ranked second in the order of elements appearing in the earth’s crust, an average of 27 percent occurring in igneous rocks. It is estimated that a cubic mile of seawater contains about 15,000 tons of silicon. It is extremely rare to find silicon in its pure crystalline form in nature, and before it can be used in making electronic devices, it must be separated from its binding elements. After individuals—chemists, material scientists, etc.—perform the purification process, the silicon is melted and spun into a large “seed” crystal. This long crystal can then be cut up into slices or wafers that semiconductor-device designers use in making electrical contraptions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00997.jpg" class="calibre943"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 4.4</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>For the semiconductor-device designer, a silicon wafer alone does not prove very useful. A designer would not use the silicon wafer in its pure form to build a device; it just does not have quite the right properties needed to be useful. A semiconductor-device designer is looking for a material that can be made to alter its conductive state, acting as a conductor at one moment and as an insulator at another moment. For the material to change states, it must be able to respond to some external force applied at will, such as an externally applied voltage. A silicon wafer alone is not going to do the trick. In fact, a pure silicon wafer acts more as an insulator than a conductor, and it does not have the ability to change conductive states when an external force is applied. Every designer today knows that a silicon wafer can be transformed and combined with other transformed silicon wafers to make devices that have the ability to alter their conductive states when an external force is applied. The transforming process is referred to as <span class="italic">doping</span>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Doping</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Doping refers to the process of “spicing up” or adding ingredients to a silicon wafer in such a way that it becomes useful to the semiconductor-device designer. Many ingredients can be added in the doping process, such as antimony, arsenic, aluminum, and gallium. These ingredients provide specialized characteristics such as frequency response to applied voltages, strength, and thermal integrity, to name a few. By far, however, the two most important ingredients that are of fundamental importance to the semiconductor-device designer are boron and phosphorus.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>When a silicon wafer is doped with either boron or phosphorus, its electrical conductivity is altered dramatically. Normally, a pure silicon wafer contains no free electrons; all four of its valence electrons are locked up in covalent bonds with neighboring silicon atoms (see <a href="#filepos1514780">Fig. 4.5</a>). Without any free electrons, an applied voltage will have little effect on producing an electron flow through the wafer.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1514780" class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00998.jpg" class="calibre944"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>A silicon wafer in pure form doesn’t contain any free charge carriers; all the electrons are locked up into covalent bonds between neighboring atoms.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 4.5</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>However, if phosphorus is added to the silicon wafer, something very interesting occurs. Unlike silicon, phosphorus has five valence electrons instead of four. Four of its valence electrons will form covalent bonds with the valence electrons of four neighboring silicon atoms (see <a href="#filepos1516240">Fig. 4.6</a>). However, the fifth valence electron will not have a “home” (binding site) and will be loosely floating about the atoms. If a voltage is applied across the silicon-phosphorus mixture, the unbound electron will migrate through the doped silicon toward the positive voltage end. By supplying more phosphorus to the mixture, a larger flow of electrons will result. Silicon that is doped with phosphorus is referred to as <span class="italic">n</span>-type silicon, or negative-charge-carrier-type silicon.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1516240" class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00999.jpg" class="calibre945"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>A phosphorus atom added to a silicon wafer provides an extra unbound electron that aids in conduction. Silicon doped with phosphorus is called re-type silicon.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 4.6</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Now, if you take pure silicon and add some boron, you will see a different kind of conduction effect. Boron, unlike silicon or phosphorus, contains only three valence electrons. When it is mixed with silicon, all three of its valence electrons will bind with neighboring silicon atoms (see <a href="#filepos1518106">Fig. 4.7</a>). However, there will be a vacant spot—called a <span class="italic">hole</span>—within the covalent bond between one boron and one silicon atom. If a voltage is applied across the doped wafer, the hole will move toward the negative voltage end, while a neighboring electron will fill in its place. Holes are considered positive charge carriers even though they do not contain a physical charge per se. Instead, it only appears as if a hole has a positive charge because of the charge imbalance between the protons within the nucleus of the silicon atom that receives the hole and the electrons in the outer orbital. The net charge on a particular silicon atom with a hole will appear to be positive by an amount of charge equivalent to one proton (or a “negative electron”). Silicon that is doped with boron is referred to as <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon, or positive-charge-carrier-type silicon.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1518106" class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01000.jpg" class="calibre946"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>When boron is added to silicon, a hole is formed. This hole acts like a positive charge (see text) that aids in conduction. Silicon doped with boron is called <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 4.7</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>As you can see, both <span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon have the ability to conduct electricity; one does it with extra unbound electrons (<span class="italic">n</span>-type silicon), and the other does it with holes (<span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon).</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">A Note to Avoid Confusion</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Boron atoms have three valence electrons, not four like silicon. This means that the combined lattice structure has fewer free valence electrons as a whole. However, this does not mean that a <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon semiconductor has an overall positive charge; the missing electrons in the structure are counterbalanced by the missing protons in the nuclei of the boron atoms. The same idea goes for <span class="italic">n</span>-type silicon, but now the extra electrons within the semiconductor are counterbalanced by the extra protons within the phosphorus nuclei.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Another Note to Avoid Confusion (Charge Carriers)</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>What does it mean for a hole to flow? I mean, a hole is nothing, right? How can nothing flow? Well, it is perhaps misleading, but when you hear the phrase “hole flow” or “flow of positive charge carriers in <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon,” electrons are in fact flowing. You may say, doesn’t that make this just like the electron flow in <span class="italic">n</span>-type silicon? No. Think about tipping a sealed bottle of water upside down and then right side up (see <a href="#filepos1521771">Fig. 4.8</a>). The bubble trapped in the bottle will move in the opposite direction of the water. For the bubble to proceed, water has to move out of its way. In this analogy, the water represents the electrons in the <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon, and the holes represent the bubble. When a voltage is applied across a <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon semiconductor, the electrons around the boron atom will be forced toward the direction of the positive terminal. Now here is where it gets tricky. A hole next to a boron atom will be pointing toward the negative terminal. This hole is just waiting for an electron from a neighboring atom to fall into it, due in part to the lower energy configuration there. Once an electron, say, from a neighboring silicon atom, falls into the hole in the boron atom’s valence shell, a hole is briefly created in that silicon atom’s valence shell. The electrons in the silicon atom lean toward the positive terminal, and the newly created hole leans toward the negative terminal. The next silicon atom over will let go of one of its electrons, and the electron will fall into the hole, and the hole will move over again—the process continues, and it appears as if the hole flows in a continuous motion through the <span class="italic">p</span>-type semiconductor.</span></div>

<div class="calibre3"><span><a></a><span class="bold">A Final Note to Avoid Confusion</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>And finally, why is a hole called a positive charge carrier? How can “nothing” carry a positive charge? Well, what’s going on here is this: A hole, as it moves through the mostly silicon-based crystal, causes a brief alteration in the electrical field strength around the silicon atom in the crystal where it happens to be situated. When an electron moves out of the way, thus creating a new hole, this silicon atom as a whole will be missing an electron, and hence the positive charge from the nucleus of the silicon atom will be felt (one of the protons is not counterbalanced). The “positive charge carrier” attributed to holes comes from this effective positive nuclear charge of the protons fixed within the nucleus.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>You may be asking yourself, Why are these two new types of silicon (<span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type) so useful and interesting? What good are they for semiconductor-device designers? Why is there such a fuss over them? These doped silicon crystals are now conductors. Big deal, right? Yes, we now have two new conductors, but the two new conductors have two unique ways of passing an electric current—one does it with holes, the other with electrons. This is very important.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>The manners in which <span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon conduct electricity (electron flow and hole flow) are very important in designing electronic devices such as diodes, transistors, and solar cells. Some clever people figured out ways to arrange slabs, chucks, strings, etc. made of <span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon in such a way that when an external voltage or current is applied to these structures, unique and very useful features result. These unique features are made possible by the interplay between hole flow and electron flow between the <span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type semiconductors. With these new <span class="italic">n</span>-type/<span class="italic">p</span>-type contraptions, designers began building one-way gates for current flow, opening and closing channels for current flow controlled by an external electrical voltage and/or current. Folks figured out that when an <span class="italic">n</span>-type and a <span class="italic">p</span>-type semiconductor were placed together and a particular voltage was applied across the slabs, light, or photons, could be produced as the electrons jumped across the junction between the interface. It was noticed that this process could work backward as well. That is, when light was exposed at the <span class="italic">np</span> junction, electrons were made to flow, thus resulting in an electric current. A number of clever contraptions have been built using <span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type semiconductor combinations. The following chapters describe some of the major devices people came up with.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>A <span class="italic">diode</span> is a two-lead semiconductor device that acts as a one-way gate to electric current flow. When a diode’s <span class="italic">anode</span> lead is made more positive in voltage than its <span class="italic">cathode</span> lead—a condition referred to as <span class="italic">forward biasing</span>—current is permitted to flow through the device.

<div class="calibre11"><span>A <span class="italic">p-n junction diode</span> (<span class="italic">rectifier diode</span>) is formed by sandwiching together <span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon. In practice, manufacturers grow an <span class="italic">n</span>-type silicon crystal and then abruptly change it to a <span class="italic">p</span>-type crystal. Then either a glass or plastic coating is placed around the joined crystals. The <span class="italic">n</span> side is the cathode end, and the p side is the anode end.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>The trick to making a one-way gate from these combined pieces of silicon is getting the charge carriers in both the <span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon to interact in such a way that when a voltage is applied across the device, current will flow in only one direction. Both <span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon conducts electric current; one does it with electrons (<span class="italic">n</span>-type), and the other does it with holes (<span class="italic">p</span>-type). Now the important feature to note here, which makes a diode work (act as a one-way gate), is the manner in which the two types of charge carriers interact with each other and how they interact with an applied electrical field supplied by an external voltage across its leads. Below is an explanation describing how the charge carriers interact with each other and with the electrical field to create an electrically controlled one-way gate.</span></div>

The electrons and holes combine, and current passes through the diode.

<div class="calibre26"><span>A diode’s one-way gate feature does not work all the time. That is, it takes a minimal voltage to turn it on when it is placed in forward-biased direction. Typically for silicon diodes, an applied voltage of 0.6 V or greater is needed; otherwise, the diode will not conduct. This feature of requiring a specific voltage to turn the diode on may seem like a drawback, but in fact, this feature becomes very useful in terms of acting as a voltage-sensitive switch. Germanium diodes, unlike silicon diodes, often require a forward-biasing voltage of only 0.2 V or greater for conduction to occur. <a href="#filepos1531113">Figure 4.12</a> shows how the current and voltage are related for silicon and germanium diodes.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>Another fundamental difference between silicon diodes and germanium diodes, besides the forward-biasing voltages, is their ability to dissipate heat. Silicon diodes do a better job of dissipating heat than germanium diodes. When germanium diodes get hot—temperatures exceeding 85°C—the thermal vibrations affect the physics inside the crystalline structure to a point where normal diode operation becomes unreliable. Above 85°C, germanium diodes become worthless.</span></div>

As a general rule of thumb, silicon p-n junction diodes have about a 0.6-V threshold, germanium diodes a 0.2-V threshold, and Schottky diodes a 0.4-V threshold. However, don’t take this rule too seriously, because with real-life components, you’ll find these thresholds may be a few tenths of a volt off. For example, it’s entirely possible for a p-n junction diode’s threshold to be anywhere between 0.6 and 1.7 V; for germanium, 0.2 to 0.4 V; and for Schottky diodes, 0.15 to 0.9 V.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>There are numerous types of diodes, each specifically designed to work better in one application or another. Diodes for high-power applications (switching, power supplies, etc.) which draw lots of current or rectify high voltages typically go by the name <span class="italic">rectifier diodes</span>. On the other hand, diodes that go by names such as <span class="italic">signal, switching, fast recovery</span>, or <span class="italic">high speed</span> are designed to provide a low internal capacitance (they store less charge but usually have weaker junctions for large currents). At high speeds, these diodes will reduce RC switching time constants, which means fewer time delays and lower signal losses.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a><span class="italic">Schottky diodes</span> have a particularly low junction capacitance and faster switching (∼10 ns) when compared to silicon p-n junction diodes due to their special metal-semiconductor-junction interface. They also have a lower junction threshold voltage—as low as 0.15 V, but usually a bit more (0.4 V average). Both these characteristics enable them to detect low-voltage, high-frequency signals that ordinary p-n junction diodes would not see. (A Schottky with a 0.3-V threshold can pass signals greater than 0.3 V, but a silicon p-n junction diode with a 0.7-V threshold can only pass signals greater than 0.7 V.) For this reason, Schottky diodes are very popular in low-voltage signal rectifiers in RF circuits, signal switching in telecommunication, small dc/dc converters, small low-voltage power supplies, protection circuits, and voltage clamping arrangements. Their high-current density and low voltage drop also make them great in power supplies, since they generate less heat, requiring smaller heat sinks to be used in design. Therefore, you’ll find both rectifier and fast-switching Schottky diodes listed in the catalogs.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>In terms of <span class="italic">germanium diodes</span>, they are used mostly in RF signal detection and low-level logic design due to their small threshold voltage of about 0.2 V. You do not see them in high-current rectifying applications, since they are weaker and leak more than silicon diodes when temperatures rise. In many applications, a good Schottky signal diode can replace a germanium diode.</span></div>

Each of these characteristics can be manipulated during the manufacturing process to produce the various special-purpose diodes. In rectification applications (e.g., power supplies, transient protection), the most important specs are PIV and current rating. The peak negative voltages that are stopped by the diode must be smaller in magnitude than the PIV, and the peak current through the diode must be less than <span class="italic">I</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><span class="italic">O</span>(max)</span></small></sub>.

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>When current passes through a diode, there is a voltage drop across it of about 0.6 V, for a silicon p-n junction diode. (Germanium diodes have around a 0.2-V drop; Schottky, around 0.4 V—all these values vary slightly, depending on the specific diode used.) By placing a number of diodes in series, the total voltage drop across the combination is the sum of the individual voltage drops across each diode. Voltage droppers are often used in circuits where a fixed small voltage difference between two sections of a circuit is needed. Unlike resistors that can be used to lower the voltage, the diode arrangement typically doesn’t waste as much power to resistive heating and will supply a stiffer regulated voltage that is less dependent on current variations. Later in this chapter, you’ll see that a single zener diode can often replace a multiple series diode arrangement like the one shown here.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span><a></a>Battery reversal or power polarity reversal can be fatal to portable equipment. The best design is to use a mechanical block to safeguard against reverse installation. However, even momentarily fumbling around and making contacts can lead to problems. This is especially true for one or more single-cell battery applications that use AA-alkaline, NiCad, and NiMH batteries. For these systems you must ensure that any flow of reverse current is low enough to avoid damaging the circuit or the battery.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01013.jpg" class="calibre958"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 4.17 <span class="italic">Series diode:</span> This is the simplest battery-reversal protection. It can be used with external power connections, too—plug-and-jack. The diode allows current from a correctly installed battery to flow to load, but blocks current flow from a backward-installed battery. The drawback with a series diode is that the diode must handle the full load current. Also, the forward voltage drop of the diode shortens the equipment’s operating time—cuts off about 0.6 V right away. Schottky diodes with low thresholds can do better. See Problem 1 at the end of <a href="#filepos1525597">Section 4.2</a> for another reverse-polarity protection circuit.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span><span class="italic">Parallel diode:</span> In applications that call for alkaline or other batteries that have high output impedances, you can guard against reverse installations by using a parallel (shunt) diode, while eliminating the diode’s voltage drop. This approach protects the load but draws high current from the backward-installed battery. The diode must be properly rated for current and power. Another application of the parallel diode is in meter protection, where it acts to divert large currents entering the negative terminal of the meter.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span><span class="italic">Note:</span> In more sophisticated battery-powered designs, special ICs or transistor arrangements are used to provide essentially zero voltage drop protection, while providing a number of other special features, such as reverse polarity protection, thermal shutdown, and voltage level monitor.</span></span></span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>When current flowing through an inductor is suddenly switched off, the collapsing magnetic field will generate a high-voltage spike in the inductor’s coils. This voltage spike or transient may have an amplitude of hundreds or even thousands of volts. This is particularly common within relay coils. A diode—referred to as a fly-back diode for this type of application—placed across the relay’s coil can protect neighboring circuitry by providing a short circuit for the high-voltage spike. It also protects the relay’s mechanical contacts, which often get viciously slapped shut during an inductive spike. Notice, however, that the diode is ineffective during turn-on time. Select a rectifier diode with sufficient power ratings (1N4001, 1N4002, etc.). Schottky rectifiers (e.g., 1N5818) work well, too.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Here’s a more practical example for driving a relay that contains an extra diode placed across a transistor driver in order to protect the transistor from damage due to inductive spikes generated from the relay’s coil when the transistor is turned off. This arrangement also deadens spikes during turn-on time. This dual diode arrangement is sometimes used in voltage regulator circuits, where one diode is wired from the output to the input and another is wired from ground to the output. This prevents any attached loads from sending damaging spikes back into the IC’s output.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre10"> </div>

The diode reroutes or shorts the induced voltage to the opposite terminal of the motor. Here a 1N5818 Schottky diode is used—though you could use other p-n junction types, too. The Schottky diode happens to be a bit faster and will clip the transient voltage a bit lower down—at around 0.4 V.<br class="calibre16"/>    <span class="italic">Note:</span> Devices such as TVs and varistors are specially designed for transient suppression.

<div class="calibre11"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span><span class="italic">Full-wave center-tap rectifier:</span> This commonly used circuit is basically two combined half-wave rectifiers that transform both halves of an ac wave into a pulsing dc signal. When designing power supplies, you need only two diodes, provided you use a center-tap transformer. The average output voltage is 0.9 <span class="italic">V</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">rms</sub></span></small> of half the transformer secondary; this is the maximum that can be obtained with a suitable choke-input filter.

The PIV impressed on each diode is independent of the type of load at the output. This is because the peak inverse voltage condition occurs when diode A conducts and diode B does not conduct. As the cathodes of diodes A and B reach a positive peak (1.4 <span class="italic">V</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">rms</sub></span></small>), the anode of diode B is at the negative peak, also 1.4 <span class="italic">V<small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">rms</sub></span></small></span>, but in the opposite direction.

These diodes will require twice the maximum inverse voltage ratings of the bridge diodes (PIV &gt; 2.8 <span class="italic">V</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">rms</sub></span></small>, as opposed to &gt;1.4 <span class="italic">V</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">rms</sub></span></small>). The diode current ratings are identical for the two circuits. The bridge makes better use of the transformer’s secondary than the center-tap rectifier, since the transformer’s full winding supplies power during both half cycles, while each half of the center-tap circuit’s secondary provides power only during its positive half-cycle. This is often referred to as the <span class="italic">transformer utilization factor</span>, which is unity for the bridge configuration and 0.5 for the full-wave center-tap configuration.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>The bridge rectifier is often not as popular as the full-wave center-tap rectifier in high-current, low-voltage applications. This is because the two forward-conducting series-diode voltage drops in the bridge introduce a volt or more of additional loss, and thus consume more power (heat loss) than a single diode would within a full-wave rectifier.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>In regard to the half-wave configuration, it’s rarely used in 60-Hz rectification for other than bias supplies. It does see considerable use, however, in high-frequency switching power supplies in what are called forward converter and fly-back converter topologies.</span></div>
