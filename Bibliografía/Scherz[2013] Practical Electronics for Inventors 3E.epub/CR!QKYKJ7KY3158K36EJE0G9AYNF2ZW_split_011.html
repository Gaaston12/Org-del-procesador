<div class="calibre3"><span><a></a><span class="bold">Surgector</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>There are other transient voltage suppression devices out there, such as the Surgector, gas discharge, and spark gap TVSs. The Surgector utilizes silicon thyristor technology to provide bidirectional “crowbar” clamping action for transients of either polarity. This is accomplished with a five-layer p-n junction structure. Surgectors remain in a low-leakage, reverse-bias state, presenting effectively no load to the circuit as long as the applied voltage is at or below its <span class="italic">V</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">DRM</sub></span></small> rating. A transient voltage exceeding this value will cause the device to avalanche (breakdown), beginning the clamping action across the line to which it is connected. As the leading edge of the transient voltage attempts to rise higher, the Surgector current will increase through the circuit’s source impedance until the <span class="italic">V</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">BO</sub></span></small>, or breakover voltage mode, is reached. Thyristor action is then rapidly triggered, and the Surgector switches to its “on,” or latched state. This very low impedance state crowbars the line with effectively the characteristics of a forward p-n junction, thereby short-circuiting the transient voltage.</span></div>

<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">PolySwitch</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>A PolySwitch (also known as polyfuse, multiswitch, and generically resettable fuse) is a special positive temperature coefficient resistor that is constructed from a conductive polymer mix. It resembles a varistor and PTC thermistor in one. At normal temperatures, the conductive particles within the polymer form densely packed low-resistance chains, allowing current to flow easily. However, if the current flow through the PolySwitch increases to a point where its temperature rises above a critical level, the crystalline structure of the polymer suddenly changes into an expanded amorphous state. At this point, the device’s resistance dramatically increases, causing a sudden drop in current flow. The point at which this occurs is referred to as the <span class="italic">trip current</span>. If the voltage level is maintained after tripping, enough holding current will generally flow, keeping the device in a tripped state. The PolySwitch will reset itself only if the voltage is reduced and the device is allowed to cool, at which point the polymer particles rapidly return to their densely packed state, and the resistance drops.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>PolySwitches can be used in numerous applications wherever you need a low-cost, self-resetting solid-state circuit breaker. They are used to limit over-current in speakers, power supplies, battery packs, motors, etc. For example, <a href="#filepos1850519">Fig. 4.135</a> shows how a PolySwitch used to protect a speaker from excessive current sourced by an amplifier. The PolySwitch is rated with a trip current that is slightly higher than that rated for the power level the speaker can handle. For example, an 8-Ω, 5-W speaker has a maximum current rating determined by the generalized power law.</span></div>

<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Avalanche Diodes</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Avalanche diodes are designed to break down and conduct at a specified reverse-bias voltage. This behavior is similar to that of a zener diode, but its operation is caused by a different mechanism, called the <span class="italic">avalanche effect</span> (a reverse electric field applied across a p-n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current). However, unlike zener diodes that are rather restricted in maximum breakdown voltage, avalanche diodes are available with breakdown voltage of over 4000 V. Avalanche diodes are used in circuits to guard against damaging high-voltage transients. They are connected to a circuit so that they’re reverse-biased (the cathode is set positive with respect to the anode). In this configuration, the avalanche diode is nonconducting and doesn’t interfere with the circuit. However, if the voltage rises beyond a safe design limit, the diode goes into avalanche breakdown, eliminating the harmful voltage by shunting current to ground. Avalanche diodes are specified with a clamping voltage <span class="italic">V</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sub class="calibre37">BR</sub></span></small> and a maximum-size transient that it can absorb, specified either in terms of joules of energy or as <span class="italic">I</span><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17"><sup class="calibre29">2</sup></span></small><span class="italic">t</span>. The avalanche breakdown event is not destructive, provided the diode isn’t overheated. One side effect that occurs in avalanche diodes is RF noise generation.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00007.jpg" class="calibre36"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>An integrated circuit (IC) is a miniaturized circuit that contains a number of resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors stuffed together on a single chip of silicon no bigger than your fingernail. The number of resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors within an IC may vary from just a few to millions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>The trick to cramming everything into such a small package is to make all the components out of tiny <span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type silicon structures that are embedded into the silicon chip during the production phase. To connect the little transistors, resistors, capacitors, and diodes together, aluminum plating is applied along the surface of the chip. <a href="#filepos1853788">Figure 4.136</a> shows a magnified cross-sectional view of an IC showing how the various components are embedded and linked together.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>ICs come in analog, digital, or analog/digital form:</span></div>
<div class="calibre187"><span>•  Analog (or linear) ICs produce, amplify, or respond to varying voltages. Some common analog ICs include voltage regulators, operational amplifiers, comparators, timers, and oscillators.</span></div>
<div class="calibre27"><span>•  Digital (or logic) ICs respond to or produce signals having only high and low voltage states. Common digital ICs include logic gates (such as AND, OR, or NOR), microcontrollers, memories, binary counters, shift registers, multiplexers, encoders, and decoders.</span></div>
<div class="calibre27"><span>•  Analog/digital ICs share properties common with both analog and digital ICs. Analog/digital ICs may take a number of different forms. For example, the IC may be designed primarily as an analog timer but may contain a digital counter. Alternatively, the IC may be designed to read in digital information and then use this information to produce a linear output that can be used to drive, say, a stepper motor or LED display.</span></div>
<div class="calibre30"><span>ICs are so pervasive that you are likely to use them in any project that you will undertake. You will find them used in many of the chapters that follow.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>ICs come in many and various packages (see <a href="#filepos1856246">Fig. 4.137</a>). The determining factors for the package type are the number of pins and the power dissipation. For example, a high-power voltage regulator IC may have three pins and look just like a high-power transistor.</span></div>

There are also surface-mount versions of the DIL packages, as well as packages arranged as a square with pins on all sides. Some of the surface-mount packages have extremely small spacing between pins—sometimes as small as 0.5 mm, which is two pins every millimeter and not really intended for hand soldering.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span><span class="italic">Optoelectrics</span> is a branch of electronics that deals with light-emitting and light-detecting devices. Light-emitting devices, such as lamps and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), create electromagnetic energy (e.g., light) by using an electric current to excite electrons into higher energy levels (when an electron changes energy levels, a photon is emitted). Light-detecting devices such as phototransistors and photoresistors, on the other hand, are designed to take incoming electromagnetic energy and convert it into electric currents and voltages. This is usually accomplished using photons to liberate bound electrons within semiconductor materials. Light-emitting devices typically are used for illumination purposes or as indicator lights. Light-detecting devices are used primarily in light-sensing and communication devices, such as dark-activated switches and remote controls. This chapter examines the following optoelectronic devices: lamps, LEDs, photoresistors, photodiodes, solar cells, phototransistors, photothyristors, and optoisolators.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00007.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span><a></a><span class="italic">Photons</span> are the elemental units of electromagnetic radiation. White light, for example, is composed of a number of different kinds of photons; some are blue photons, some are red photons, etc. It is important to note that there is no such thing as a white photon. Instead, when the combination of the various colored photons interacts with our eye, our brain perceives what we call <span class="italic">white light</span>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Photons are not limited to visible light alone. There are also radiofrequency photons, infrared photons, microwave photons, and other kinds of photons that our eyes cannot detect.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>In terms of the physics, photons are very interesting creatures. They have no rest mass, but they do carry momentum (energy). A photon also has a distant wavelike character within its electromagnetic bundle. The wavelength of a photon (horizontal distance between consecutive electrical or magnetic field peaks) depends on the medium in which it travels and on the source that produced it. It is this wavelength that determines the color of a photon. A photon’s frequency is related to its wavelength by λ = ν/<span class="italic">f</span>, where ν is the speed of the photon. In free space, ν is equal to the speed of light (<span class="italic">c</span> = 3.0 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">8</span></small></sup> m/s), but in other media, such as glass, ν becomes smaller than the speed of light. A photon with a large wavelength (or small frequency) is less energetic than a photon with a shorter wavelength (or a higher frequency). The energy of a photon is equal to <span class="italic">E = hf</span>, where <span class="italic">h</span> is Planck’s constant (6.63 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">−34</span></small></sup> J·s).</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>The trick to “making” a photon is to accelerate/decelerate a charged particle. For example, an electron that is made to vibrate back and forth within an antenna will produce radiofrequency photons that have very long wavelengths (low energies) when compared with light photons. Visible light, on the other hand, is produced when outer-shell electrons within atoms are forced to make transitions between energy levels, accelerating in the process. Other frequency photons may be created by vibrating or rotating molecules very quickly, while still others, specifically those with very high energy (e.g., gamma rays), can be created by the charge accelerations within the atomic nuclei.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a href="#filepos1865779">Figure 5.2</a> shows the breakdown of the electromagnetic spectrum. <span class="italic">Radiofrequency</span> photons extend from a few hertz to about 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">9</span></small></sup> Hz (wavelengths from kilometers to about 0.3 m). They are often generated by alternating currents within power lines and electric circuits such as radio and television transmitters.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><span class="italic">Microwave</span> photons extend from about 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">9</span></small></sup> up to 3 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">11</span></small></sup> Hz (wavelengths from 30 cm to 1 mm). These photons can penetrate the earth’s atmosphere and hence are used in space vehicle communications, radio astronomy, and transmitting telephone conversations to satellites. They are also used for cooking food. Microwaves are often produced by atomic transitions and by electron and nuclear spins.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><span class="italic">Infrared</span> photons extend from about 3 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">11</span></small></sup> to 4 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">14</span></small></sup> Hz. Infrared radiation is created by molecular oscillations and is commonly emitted from incandescent sources such as electric heaters, glowing coals, the sun, human bodies (which radiate photons in the range of 3000 to 10,000 nm), and special types of semiconductor devices.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><span class="italic">Light</span> photons comprise a narrow frequency band from about 3.84 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">14</span></small></sup> to about 7.69 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">14</span></small></sup> Hz and are generally produced by a rearrangement of outer electrons in atoms and molecules. For example, in the filament of an incandescent light bulb, electrons are randomly accelerated by applied voltages and undergo frequent collision. These collisions result in a wide range of electron acceleration, and as a result, a broad frequency spectrum (within the light band) results, giving rise to white light.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a><span class="italic">Ultraviolet</span> photons extend from approximately 8 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">14</span></small></sup> to 3.4 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">16</span></small></sup> Hz and are produced when an electron in an atom makes a long jump down from a highly excited state. The frequency of ultraviolet photons—unfortunately for us—tend to react badly with human cell DNA, which in turn can lead to skin cancer. The sun produces a large output of ultraviolet radiation. Fortunately for us, protective ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere can absorb most of this ultraviolet radiation by converting the photon’s energy into a vibrating motion within the ozone molecule.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span><span class="italic">X-rays</span> are highly energetic photons that extend from about 2.4 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">16</span></small></sup> to 5 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">19</span></small></sup> Hz, making their wavelengths often smaller than the diameter of an atom. One way of producing x-rays is to rapidly decelerate a high-speed charged particle. X-rays tend to act like bullets and can be used in x-ray imagery.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><span class="italic">Gamma rays</span> are the most energetic of the photons, whose frequency begins around 5 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">19</span></small></sup> Hz.

<div id="filepos1866949" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="bold">5.2   Lamps</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00007.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span><a></a>Lamps are devices that convert electric current into light energy. One approach used in the conversion process is to pass a current through a special kind of wire filament. As current collides with the filament’s atoms, the filament heats up, and photons are emitted. (As it turns out, this process produces a variety of different wavelength photons, so it appears that the emitted light is white in color.) Another approach used to produce light involves placing a pair of electrodes a small distance apart within a glass gas-enclosed bulb. When a voltage is set across the electrodes, the gas ionizes (electrons are stripped from the gas atoms) emitting photons in the process. Here’s an overview of some of the major kinds of lamps.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01225.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>These lamps use a tungsten wire filament to produce a glowing white light when current passes through it. The filament is enclosed in an evacuated glass bulb filled with a gas such as argon, krypton, or nitrogen that helps increase the brilliance of the lamp and also helps prevent the filament from burning out (as would be the case in an oxygen-rich environment). Incandescent lamps are used in flashlights, home lighting, and as indicator lights. They come in a variety of different sizes and shapes, as well as various current, voltage, and candlelight power ratings.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01226.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Similar to a typical incandescent lamp, these lamps provide ultrabright output light. Unlike a typical incandescent lamp, the filament is coated on the inside of a quartz bulb. Within this bulb, a halogen gas, such as bromine or iodine, is placed. These lamps are used in projector lamps, automotive headlights, strobe lights, etc.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01227.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>This lamp produces a dim, pale light that results from the ionization of neon gas molecules between two electrodes within the bulb. Types of gas-discharge lamps include neon, xenon flash, and mercury vapor lamps. Gas-discharge lamps have a tendency to suddenly switch on when a particular minimum operating voltage is met. For this reason, they are sometimes used in triggering and voltage-regulation applications. They are also used as indicator lights and for testing home ac power outlets.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01228.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>This is a lamp consisting of a mercury vapor–filled glass tube whose inner wall is coated with a material that fluoresces. At either end of the tube are cathode and anode incandescent filaments. When electrons emitted from an incandescent cathode electrode collide with the mercury atoms, ultraviolet (UV) radiation is emitted. The UV radiation then collides with the lamp’s florescent coating, emitting visible light in the process. Such lamps require an auxiliary glow lamp with bimetallic contacts and a choke placed in parallel with the cathode and anode to initiate discharge within the lamp. These are highly efficient lamps that are often used in home lighting applications.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><a></a><img alt="image" src="images/01229.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>This is a gas-discharge lamp that is filled with a xenon gas that ionizes when a particular voltage is applied across its electrodes. These lamps come with three leads: an anode, a cathode, and a trigger-voltage lead. Normally, a particular voltage is applied across the anode and cathode leads, and the lamp is off. However, when a particular voltage is applied to the trigger lead, the gas suddenly ionizes and releases an extremely bright flash. These lamps are used in photographic applications and in special-effects lighting projects.</span></span></span></div>

<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Technical Stuff About Light Bulbs</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>A lamp’s brightness is measured in what is called the <span class="italic">mean spherical candle power</span> (MSCP). Bulb manufacturers place a lamp at the center of an integrating sphere that averages the lamp’s light output over its surface. The actual value of the MSCP for a lamp is a function of color temperature of the emitting surface of the lamp’s filament. For a given temperature, doubling the filament’s surface area doubles the MSCP. Other technical things to consider about lamps include voltage and current ratings, life expectancy, physical geometry of the bulb, and filament type. <a href="#filepos1872942">Figure 5.4</a> shows a number of different bulb types.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>In recent years, incandescent light bulbs have become something of a rarity. In domestic lighting situations, they have almost completely been replaced by compact fluorescent designs, and indeed are not even for sale in some European countries. There is also a trend toward using arrays of LEDs for illumination in place of incandescent bulbs (see the next section). In applications that formerly would have used incandescent indicator lights, LEDs now rule supreme. LEDs have a much longer life, lower power consumption, and much greater tolerance of physical and thermal shock.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are two-lead devices that are similar to pn-junction diodes, except that they are designed to emit visible or infrared light. When a LED’s anode lead is made more positive in voltage than its cathode lead (by at least 0.6 to 2.2 V), current flows through the device and light is emitted. However, if the polarities are reversed (anode is made more negative than the cathode), the LED will not conduct, and hence it will not emit light. The symbol for an LED is shown in <a href="#filepos1874782">Fig. 5.5</a>.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>LEDs are available in a wide range of colors. Historically, red was the first LED color. Yellow and green and infrared LEDs followed. It was not until the 1990s that blue LEDs became available. These days, LEDs are available in pretty much any color, including white.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>There are also high-powered LEDs that are used for illumination and organic LEDs (OLEDs) made from polymers that can be built into displays.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>Often, LEDs (especially infrared LEDs) are used as transmitting elements in remote-control circuits (e.g., TV remote control).

<div class="calibre11"><span><a></a>The light-emitting section of an LED is made by joining <span class="italic">n</span>-type and <span class="italic">p</span>-type semiconductors together to form a <span class="italic">pn</span> junction.

As the electrons combine with the holes, photons are emitted. Typically, the <span class="italic">pn</span>-junction section of an LED is encased in an epoxy shell that is doped with light-scattering particles to diffuse the light and make the LED appear brighter. Often a reflector placed beneath the semiconductor is used to direct light upward.

<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>These LEDs are inexpensive and durable devices that typically are used as indicator lights. Common colors include green (∼565 nm), yellow (∼585 nm), orange (∼615 nm), and red (∼650 nm). Maximum forward voltages are about 1.8 V, with typical operating currents from 10 to 30 mA.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01234.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>These LEDs are designed to emit infrared photons that have wavelength between approximately 880 and 940 nm. They are used in conjunction with a photosensor (e.g., photodiode, photoresistor, phototransistor) in remote-control circuits (e.g., TV remotes, intrusion alarms). They tend to have a narrower viewing angle when compared with a visible-light LED so that transmitted information can be directed efficiently. Photon output is characterized in terms of output power per specific forward current. Typical outputs range from around 0.50 mW/20 mA to 8.0 mW/50 mA. Maximum forward voltages at specific forward currents range from about 1.60 V at 20 mA to 2.0 V at 100 mA.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01235.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>These LEDs contain a miniature integrated circuit within their package that causes the LED to flash from 1 to 6 times each second. They are used primarily as indicator flashers, but may be used as simple oscillators.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><a></a><img alt="image" src="images/01236.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Multicolor LEDs mount a number of LEDs in a single package. The color they produce is a mixture of the colors produced by each LED. The ultimate multicolor LED is an RGB LED that has red, green, and blue LEDs within a single package. This allows any color to be mixed by controlling the brightness of each of the LEDs, with white light being produced if all the LEDs are on with equal intensity. The packages usually have a common anode or common cathode connection.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>A variation on this has red and green LEDs back to back to indicate polarity (the polarity of the supply voltage will determine which LED is forward-biased and on, and which is reverse-biased and off).</span></span></span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span><a></a>LEDs emit visible light, infrared radiation, or even ultraviolet radiation when forward-biased. Visible single-tone LEDs emit relatively narrow bands of green, yellow, orange, red, and blue light (with spectrum spread usually less than 40 nm at 90 percent peak intensity). Infrared diodes emit one of several bands beyond red. White LEDs provide a variety of wavelengths to mimic white light and are used in low-level lighting applications, such as backlighting, headlamps, and nightlights.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>High-power LEDs (HPLEDs) are now available. These have forward currents of hundreds of mA to more than 1 A. Such LEDs are very bright but also generate a lot of heat. They must be mounted on a heat sink to prevent thermal destruction.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>LEDs have very fast response times, excellent efficiency, and long lifetimes. They are current-dependent devices whose light output is directly proportional to the forward current.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>To light an LED, apply a voltage greater than the LED’s forward voltage <span class="italic">V</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">LED</span></small></sub>, and limit current flow via a series resistor to a level below the LED’s maximum rating, usually to <span class="italic">I</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">LED</span></small></sub>—the manufacturer’s recommended value. The following equation is used to select the series resistor:</span></div>
<div class="calibre19"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01239.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span>If you want brightness control, throw in a 1-K potentiometer in series, as shown in <a href="#filepos1883728">Fig. 5.10</a>.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1883728" class="calibre3"><span><a></a><img alt="image" src="images/01240.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 5.10   (<span class="italic">a</span>) It’s important to keep the LED current flow below the maximum rating. Select a series current-limiting resistor according to the provided formula. A 1K pot can be added to provide variable light-intensity control. (<span class="italic">b</span>) Here’s a circuit that can be used to power LEDs from an ac line. The key is the capacitor, which acts to attenuate the ac signal, and the resistor, which acts to limit the current level. Since the capacitor must pass current in both directions, a small diode is connected in parallel with the LED to provide a path for the negative half cycle and also to limit the reverse voltage across the LED. A second LED with polarity reverse may be substituted for the diode, or a tricolor LED could be used, which would appear orange with alternating current. The resistor is chosen to limit the worst-case inrush current to about 150 mA, which will drop to less than 30 mA in a millisecond, as the capacitor charges. The 0.47-μF capacitor has a reactance of 5640 Ω at 60 Hz, so the LED current is about 20 mA half wave, or 10 mA average. A larger capacitor will increase the current and a smaller one will reduce it. The capacitor must be a nonpolarized type with a voltage rating of 200 V or more. (<span class="italic">c</span>) This is also an ac-line powered arrangement used to create a nightlight using white LEDs. Like the previous circuit, the 0.47-μF input capacitor attenuates the ac voltage level, and the 180-Ω resistor acts to limit current. The bridge rectifier with attached filter capacitor creates a near constant dc voltage, while the zener diode acts to regulate the voltage level. In this case, there are four white LEDs in series, each with a 3.4-V drop, for a total voltage drop of 13.6 V; therefore, a 15-V zener is used. (<span class="italic">d</span>) Do not put LEDs in parallel with each other without using individual dropping resistors for each LED. Although this usually works, it is not reliable. LEDs become more conductive as they warm up, which may lead to unstable current distribution through paralleled LEDs. LEDs in parallel need their own individual dropping resistors, as shown in the figure. Series strings can be paralleled if each string has its own dropping resistors. (<span class="italic">e</span>) It’s okay to put LEDs in series with a single common series resistor. Simply add up the voltage drops of all the diodes in series, and use that value in place of <span class="italic">V</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">LED</span></small></sub> in the series-resistor formula. It’s a good idea not to exceed 80 percent of the supply voltage in order to maintain good stability and predicable current consumption. (<span class="italic">f</span>) Here, a zener diode is used to create a simple voltage-level indicator: when the voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage of the zener, current flows, lighting the LED. (<span class="italic">g</span>) This circuit reverses the polarity at the output using a DPDT switch. <span class="italic">D</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">1</span></small></sub> goes on when the polarity is one way, and D<sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">2</span></small></sub> goes on when the polarity is another way. (<span class="italic">h</span>) Two LEDs in reverse-parallel make up a simple polarity indicator. Note that both LEDs appear on with ac. (<span class="italic">i</span>) Basic circuit showing how to use tricolor LEDs. (<span class="italic">j</span>) Blinking LEDs don’t require a series resistor, but don’t apply more than the recommended supply voltage—3 to 9 V is a safe range. A zener placed in reverse parallel with the blinking LED can be used for overvoltage protection. A number of standard LEDs can be made to blink using a blinking LED. You can also use the blinking LED to drive transistors that can be made to switch on and off as the blinking LED flashes.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><span class="italic">V</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">LED</span></small></sub> varies with LED color. Typical <span class="italic">V</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">LED</span></small></sub> values are 1.7 V for non-high-brightness red, 1.9 V for high-brightness high-efficiency low-current red, 2 V for orange and yellow, 2.1 V for green, 3.4 to 3.6 V for bright white and most blue types, and 6 V for 430-nm blue. Given the preceding voltage drops, it’s a good idea to use at least a 3-V supply voltage for lower-voltage LEDs, 4.5 V for 3.4-V types, and 6 V for 430-nm blue. If you don’t know the recommended I<sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">LED</span></small></sub> value of a given LED, it’s usually safe to assume it will be around 20 mA. <a href="#filepos1888949">Table 5.1</a> shows the range of LED types and corresponding characteristic values.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>Laser diodes are light-emitting diodes with two “mirrors” on the surface of the diode to create a laser cavity. When the diode is forward-biased, charges are injected into the active area of the junction, while electrons and holes recombine in the junction, creating spontaneous emission of photons. These photons can cause other electron-hole pairs to recombine by stimulated emission. When the current is high enough, the device lases. Laser diodes are driven by low-voltage power and usually incorporate optical feedback from a monitor photodiode (commonly built into the same laser diode package) to regulate the laser diode current.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01244.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 5.11   Figure shows a rough diagram of a laser diode of the type found in a laser pointer or CD player. The size of the package is typically 5 to 10 mm overall, but the laser diode chip is less than 1 mm in length. The maxim beam as it emerges from the laser diode is wedge-shaped and highly divergent (unlike a helium-neon laser) with a typical spread of 10 by 30°. External optics are required to produce anything approaching a parallel (collimated) beam. A simple (spherical) short-focal-length convex lens will work reasonably well for this purpose, but diode laser modules and laser pointers might use a lens that at least on the surface is aspheric (not ground to a spherical shape, as are most common lenses). The beam from the back end of the laser diode chip hits a built-in photodiode that is normally used in an optoelectronic feedback loop to regulate current and thus beam power.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>Compared to LEDs, laser diodes have quicker response times and very narrow spectrum spread (around 1 nm), and can focus radiation to a spot as small as 1 μm in diameter—even for a cheap laser diode using simple optics found in a CD player. Unlike gas lasers, however, a laser diode’s output beam is divergent, typically elliptical or wedge-shaped, and astigmatic, requiring refocusing.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>The output wavelength of a laser diode is usually fixed to a single mode: for example red (635 nm, 670 nm), infrared (780 nm, 800 nm, 900 nm, 1,550 nm, etc.), and green, blue, violet. However, multimode laser diodes also exist where the emission spectrum consists of several individual spectral lines with a dominant line (line with greatest intensity) occurring at the nominal wavelength of the device. Multimode laser diodes are often desirable because problems with mode hops are suppressed—consequently, they generally have a better signal-to-noise ratio. Mode hops are slight changes in the wavelength caused by thermal expansion of the laser cavity.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Typical optical output for low-powered laser diodes range from around 1 mW to 5 mW, while high-power laser diodes can reach 100 W or more. The highest-power units consist of arrays of laser diodes—not a single device alone.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Laser diodes are used in CD players, CD-ROM drives, and DVD and Blu-ray players. They are also used in laser printers, laser fax machines, laser pointers, sighting and alignment scopes, measurement equipment, high-speed fiber-optic and free-space communication systems; as pump source for other lasers; in bar-code and UPC scanners; and in high-performance imagers. In those applications requiring high-speed modulation or pulse rates (into the gigahertz range), special integrated driver chips are needed to control the laser diode drive current (more on that in a bit).</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>A variety of small laser diodes are found in CD players, CD-ROM drives, laser printers, and bar-code scanners. The most common laser diodes around are those used in CD players and CD-ROM drives. These produce a mostly invisible beam in the near infrared spectrum at 780 nm. The optical output from the actual laser diode itself may be up to 5 mW, but once it passes through the optics leading to the CD, the power drops to 0.3 to 1 mW. Higher-power IR laser diodes found in read-write drives have more power output—up to 30 mW or so. Even higher-power blue laser diodes can be found in Blu-ray players.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Visible laser diodes have replaced the helium-neon lasers used in bar-code scanners, laser pointers, positioning devices in medicine (e.g., CT and MRI scanners), and many other applications. The first visible-light laser diode emitted with a wavelength around 670 nm in the deep red spectrum. More recently, 650-and 635-nm red laser diodes have dropped in price. 635 to 650-nm laser diodes are used in DVD technology. The shorter wavelength compared to 780 nm is one of the several improvements that enable DVDs to store about eight times the amount of information as CDs (4 to 5 GB per layer and up to two layers on each side of the disc, as compared to a typical CD that stores only around 650 MB). Like the IR laser diodes, the visible laser diodes have a typical maximum power around 3 to 5 mW, and cost about $10 to $50 for the basic laser diode device—more with optics and drive electronics. Higher-power types are also available but can cost upward of several hundred dollars for something like a 20-mW module. Very high-power diode lasers using arrays of laser diodes or laser diode bars with power output of watts or greater may cost thousands of dollars.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>It’s important to note that you should never look into a laser beam or any secular reflection of the laser beam—“you might poke your eye out.” Also, laser diodes are extremely sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD), so it’s important to use grounding straps and grounded equipment when working with them, as well as following manufacturer’s suggested handling precautions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">Laser Diode Drive Circuits</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>You should never drive a laser diode without the proper drive circuitry. Without the proper drive circuitry, you can run into all sorts of problems stemming from swings in operating temperature with unstable injection current. The results can lead to a fried laser diode, or one whose life is short. For this reason, it’s important to have a driver circuit that can provide stable current without the possibility of supply transients screwing things up. Two basic techniques used to achieve stable optical output from a laser diode are described here.</span></div>
<div class="calibre187"><span><span class="italic">Automatic current control (ACC) or constant current circuit:</span> This involves driving the laser diode without a photodiode feedback loop; the laser diode is simply driven at constant current. This is a simple method to use, but the optical output will fluctuate as the laser diode temperature changes. However, there are circuits and corresponding laser diodes that are designed to control the diode’s operating temperature (without using the photodiode) that are very popular. The constant current circuit with temperature control provides faster control loop and precision current reference for accurately monitoring laser current. In addition, in many cases, the laser diode’s internal photodiode may exhibit drift and have a poor noise characteristic. If performance of the internal photodiode is inferior, the laser diode’s optical output is liable to be noisy and unstable. Constant current operation without temperature control, however, is generally not a good idea, except in cheap, low-power situations (cheap laser pointers, etc.). If the operating temperature of the laser diode decreases significantly, the optical power output will increase, and this could easily exceed its maximum rating.</span></div>
<div class="calibre187"><span><span class="italic">Automatic power control (APC) circuit:</span> This drive circuit is based on a photodiode feedback loop that monitors the optical output and provides a control signal for the laser diode to maintain a constant optical output level. Constant power control prevents the possibility of the optical power output increasing as the laser diode’s temperature decreases. However, when operating in the constant power mode and without temperature control, mode hops and changes in wavelength will still occur. Also, if the diode’s heat sink is inadequate and the temperature is allowed to rise, the optical power will decrease. In turn, the drive circuit will increase the injection current, attempting to maintain the optical power at a constant level. Without an absolute current limit, thermal runaway is possible and the laser may be damaged or destroyed in the process.</span></div>
<div class="calibre30"><span>Regardless of the type of drive circuit used, the key is to prevent the drive current from overshooting the maximum operating level. Exceeding the maximum optical output, even for a nanosecond, will damage the mirror coatings on the laser diode end facets. Your typical laboratory power supply should not be used to directly drive a laser diode—it simply doesn’t provide enough protection. Typical drive circuits incorporate slow-start circuitry, capacitive filtering, and other provisions to eliminate supply spikes, surges, and other switching transients.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a><a href="#filepos1901945">Figure 5.12</a> shows a few do-it-yourself laser diode supplies. Though these drive circuits will work with many low-powered laser diodes that don’t require modulation, it’s worth your while to check out the laser data manufacturer’s data sheets for recommended drive circuits. Creating your own drive circuits can be very tricky, and you’ll probably end up frying a few expensive laser diodes in the process. Of course, you can also buy a laser diode drive chip, which may be the best bet if you’re doing something a bit more complex than creating a laser pointer. These drive chips may support high-bit-rate modulation in addition to providing the constant current needed for optically stable power. Other types of chips can be adapted to linear and switching regulators. Some companies worth checking out include MAXIM, Linear Technology, Sharp, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Analog Devices, and Burr-Brown. Often, these manufacturers provide free samples.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1901945" class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01245.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 5.12   (<span class="italic">a</span>) This circuit can be used to identify the proper connections and polarity and then to drive the laser diode for testing purposes. Here a 0- to 10-VDC supply with current-limiting resistor is in series with the diode. If your power supply has a current limiter, set it at 20 to 25 mA to start. You can always increase it later. <span class="italic">R</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">2</span></small></sub> limits the maximum current. If you know the specs for your diode, this is a good idea (and to protect your power supply, too). You can always reduce its value if your laser diode requires more than about 85 mA (with <span class="italic">R</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">2</span></small></sub> = 100 Ω). (<span class="italic">b</span>) This runs on a (wall adapter) power supply from 6 to 9 V. There is heavy capacitive filtering in this circuit. Changes would be needed to enable this circuit to be modulated at any reasonable rate. Note that <span class="italic">C</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">4</span></small></sub> is estimated; also, an LM341 shunt regulator set up as a 2.5-V reference could replace the 2.5-V zener. (<span class="italic">c</span>) The resistor value depends on your specific laser diode current requirements. Power is provided by a 5.5- to 9-VDC battery. For the resistor, a small 10-Ω carbon resistor in series with a precision 20-Ω adjustable resistor can be used. It’s a good idea to place three ordinary diodes in series instead of a laser diode, then measure the current through them and adjust the resistor until the necessary current level is reached, in this case 50 to 60 mA. You can turn up the current, never exceeding your diode’s maximum limit. The dim glow will increase in intensity, but at some point a distinctive step in intensity is reached. (<span class="italic">d</span>) This circuit is from an inexpensive laser pointer. It includes some capacitive filtering, as well as a power-adjust pot <span class="italic">R</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">1</span></small></sub>. Unlike the previous circuit, this one doesn’t have any absolute reference, so power output will be dependent on the battery voltage to some extent. It’s possible to modulate this module at a reasonable frequency by removing or greatly reducing the value of the filter capacitor <span class="italic">C</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">1</span></small></sub>.</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><a></a><span class="bold">DRIVE CIRCUIT PRECAUTIONS</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Even with a suitable drive circuit, watch out for intermittent or unreliable connections between the laser diode and the drive circuit. An intermittent contact in the photodiode feedback circuit will usually destroy a laser diode. Even if a power-control potentiometer’s wiper breaks contact with the resistive element, there can be problems. Also, never use a switch or relay to make or break the connection between the drive circuit and the laser diode. The following are some other laser diode precautions:</span></div>
<div class="calibre187"><span><span class="italic">Power measurement:</span> It’s not safe to assume that the optical power output of a laser diode will match what’s stated in the manufacturer’s minimum-maximum data—each diode will have a unique operating characteristic as a result of manufacturing tolerances. For accuracy, you must measure the output with an optical power meter or a calibrated photodiode. Remember, once the laser diode is past the threshold point, stimulated emission is achieved and the optical output increases significantly for a small increase in forward current. Therefore, a very slight increase in drive current may cause the optical output to exceed the absolute maximum. Also, make sure to include optical losses through any lenses or other components when making measurements and calculations.</span></div>
<div class="calibre187"><span><span class="italic">Operating temperature and heat sinks:</span> In most applications, laser diodes require heat sinks, especially when operating continuously. Without a heat sink, the laser diode junction temperature will quickly increase, causing optical output to degrade. If the laser diode temperature continues to rise, exceeding the maximum operating temperature, the diode can be catastrophically damaged or the long-term performance may degrade significantly. Generally, a lower operating temperature will help extend the diode’s lifetime. Visible laser diodes with lower wavelengths (e.g., ∼635 nm) are typically more sensitive to temperature than the IR laser diodes. Often, thermoelectric cooling is required to keep temperatures down. When using heat sinks, a small amount of non-silicone-type heat sink compound improves thermal conductivity between laser diode and heat sink.</span></div>
<div class="calibre187"><span><span class="italic">Windows:</span> Keep laser diode windows and other opticals in the path clean. Dust or fingerprints will cause diffraction or interference in the laser output that can result in lower output or anomalies in the far-field pattern. The window should be cleaned using a cotton swab and ethanol.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><span class="bold">The Easy Way Out: Laser Diode Modules and Laser Pointers</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span><a></a>If all you really want is a visible laser to shoot around, a commercial diode laser module or some brands of laser pointers (those that include optical feedback based on laser power regulation) may be the ticket. Both the modules and laser pointers include a driver circuit capable of operating reliably on unregulated low-voltage dc input and a collimating lens matched to the laser diode. Many of the modules will permit fine adjustment of the lens position to optimize the collimation or permit focusing to a point at a particular distance. However, neither the module nor the pointer is designed to be modulated at any more than a few hertz, due to heavy internal filtering designed to protect the laser diode from power spikes. Therefore, they are generally not suited for laser communication applications. In general, it’s a whole lot easier starting out with the module or pointer rather than a laser diode and homemade power supply, or even a commercial driver, if it isn’t explicitly designed for your particular laser diode. There is no way to know how reliable or robust an inexpensive laser pointer will be, or if the beam quality will be acceptable. Diode laser modules are generally more expensive and of higher quality than the pointers, so they may be better for serious applications. Also, consider a helium-neon laser, since even the cheapest type is likely to generate a beam with better beam quality than the typical diode laser module or laser pointer.</span></div>

In terms of operation, a photoresistor is usually very resistive (in the megaohms) when placed in the dark. However, when it is illuminated, its resistance decreases significantly; it may drop as low as a few hundred ohms, depending on the light intensity. In terms of applications, photoresistors are used in light- and dark-activated switching circuits and in light-sensitive detector circuits. <a href="#filepos1917125">Figure 5.13</a> shows the symbol for a photoresistor.</span></div>

<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Photoresistors are made from a special kind of semiconductor crystal, such as cadmium sulfide (for light) or lead sulfide (for infrared). When this semiconductor is placed in the dark, electrons within its structure do not want to flow through the resistor because they are too strongly bound to the crystal’s atoms. However, when illuminated, incoming photons of light collide with the bound electrons, stripping them from the binding atom, thus creating a hole in the process. These liberated electrons can now contribute to the current flowing through the device (the resistance goes down).</span></span></span></div>

In general, photoresistors pretty much all function in a similar manner. However, the sensitivity and resistance range of a photoresistor may vary greatly from one device to the next. Also, certain photoresistor may respond better to light that contains photons within a particular wavelength of the spectrum. For example, cadmium sulfide photoresistors respond best to light within the 400- to 800-nm range, whereas lead sulfide photoresistors respond best to infrared photons.</span></div>

The <span class="italic">n</span> side of the combination is considered the cathode, while the <span class="italic">p</span> side is considered the anode. Now, if you shine light on this device, a number of photons will pass through the <span class="italic">n</span>-semiconductor and into the <span class="italic">p</span>-semiconductor.

However, when the light-sensitive region is exposed to light, a small base current is generated that controls a much larger collector-to-emitter current. Field-effect phototransistors (photoFETs) are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs use light to generate a gate voltage that is used to control a drain-source current. PhotoFETs are extremely sensitive to variations in light but are more fragile (electrically speaking) than bipolar phototransistors.</span></div>

<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Two-lead phototransistors may not be able to inject enough electrons into the base region to promote a desired collector-to-emitter current. For this reason, a three-lead phototransistor with a base lead may be used. The extra base lead can be fed external current to help boost the number of electrons injected into the base region. In effect, the base current depends on both the light intensity and the supplied base current. With optoelectronic circuits, three-lead phototransistors are often used in place of two-lead devices, provided the base is left untouched.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01265.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>This is similar to a conventional bipolar Darlington transistor but is light-sensitive. Photodarlingtons are much more sensitive to light than ordinary phototransistors, but they tend to have slower response times. These devices may or may not come with a base lead.</span></span></span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>Like ordinary transistors, phototransistors have maximum breakdown voltages and current and power dissipation ratings. The collector current <span class="italic">I<sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">C</span></small></sub></span> through a phototransistor depends directly on the input radiation density, the dc current gain of the device, and the external base current (for three-lead phototransistors). When a phototransistor is used to control a collector-to-emitter current, a small amount of leakage current, called the <span class="italic">dark current I<sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">D</span></small></sub></span>, will flow through the device even when the device is kept in the dark.

<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Here, a phototransistor is used to control the base current supplied to a power-switching transistor that is used to supply current to a relay. In the light-activated circuit, when light comes in contact with the phototransistor, the phototransistor turns on, allowing current to pass from the supply into the base of the power-switching transistor. The power-switching transistor then turns on, and current flows through the relay, triggering it to switch states. In the dark-activated circuit, an opposite effect occurs. When light is removed from the phototransistor, the phototransistor turns off, allowing more current to enter the base of the power-switching transistor. The 100-k potentiometers are used to adjust the sensitivity of both devices by controlling current flow through the phototransistor.</span></span></span></div>

<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Here is a simple example of how a phototransistor can be used as a simple frequency counter, or tachometer.

A frequency counter is used to count the number of electrical pulses generated.</span></span></span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00007.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Photothyristors are light-activated thyristors. Two common photothyristors include the light-activated SCR (LASCR) and the light-activated triac. A LASCR acts like a switch that changes states whenever it is exposed to a pulse of light. Even when the light is removed, the LASCR remains on until the anode and cathode polarities are reversed or the power is removed. A light-active triac is similar to a LASCR but is designed to handle ac currents. The symbol for a LASCR is shown below.</span></div>

<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>The equivalent circuit shown here helps explain how a LASCR works. Again, like other <span class="italic">p-n</span> junction optoelectronic device, a photon will collide with an electron in the <span class="italic">p</span>-semiconductor side, and an electron will be ejected across the <span class="italic">p-n</span> junction into the <span class="italic">n</span> side. When a number of photons liberate a number of electrons across the junction, a large enough current at the base is generated to turn the transistors on. Even when the photons are eliminated, the LASCR will remain on until the polarities of the anode and cathode are reversed or the power is cut. (This results from the fact that the transistors’ bases are continuously simulated by the main current flowing through the anode and cathode leads.)</span></span></span></div>

<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>When no light is present, the LASCR is off; no current will flow through the load.

<div class="calibre11"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00007.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Optoisolators/optocouplers are devices that interconnect two circuits by means of an optical interface. For example, a typical optoisolator may consist of an LED and a phototransistor enclosed in a light-tight container. The LED portion of the optoisolator is connected to the source circuit, whereas the phototransistor portion is connected to the detector circuit. Whenever the LED is supplied current, it emits photons that are detected by the phototransistor. There are many other kinds of source-sensor combinations, such as LED-photodiode, LED-LASCR, and lamp-photoresistor pairs.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>In terms of applications, optoisolators are used frequently to provide electrical isolation between two separate circuits. This means that one circuit can be used to control another circuit without undesirable changes in voltage and current that might occur if the two circuits were connected electrically. Isolation couplers typically are enclosed in a dark container, with both source and sensor facing each other. In such an arrangement, the optoisolator is referred to as a <span class="italic">closed pair</span> (see <a href="#filepos1948248">Fig. 5.30<span class="italic">a</span></a>). Besides being used for electrical isolation applications, closed pairs are also used for level conversions and solid-state relaying. A <span class="italic">slotted coupler/interrupter</span> is a device that contains an open slot between the source and sensor through which a blocker can be placed to interrupt light signals (see <a href="#filepos1948248">Fig. 5.30<span class="italic">b</span></a>). These devices are frequently used for object detection, bounce-free switching, and vibration detection. A <span class="italic">reflective pair</span> is another kind of optoisolator configuration that uses a source to emit light and a sensor to detect that light once it has reflected off an object. Reflective pairs are used as object detectors, reflectance monitors, tachometers, and movement detectors (see <a href="#filepos1948248">Fig. 5.30<span class="italic">c</span></a>).</span></div>

<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>Here, a diode/phototransistor optoisolator is used to provide electrical isolation between the source circuit and the sensor circuit, as well as providing a dc level shift in the output. In the leftmost circuit, the output is noninverted, while the output in the rightmost circuit is inverted.</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01276.jpg" class="calibre1157"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>In optoelectronic applications, the phototransistor section of an optoisolator may not be able to provide enough power-handling capacity to switch large currents.

<div class="calibre11"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00007.jpg" class="calibre36"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>While strictly speaking, optical fibers are “optical” rather than “optoelectrical,” they are often used with photodiodes and LEDs/laser diodes as a medium through which to carry data encoded on beams of light. <a href="#filepos1951846">Figure 5.34</a> shows how an optical fiber works.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1951846" class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01278.jpg" class="calibre109"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 5.34   Optical fiber</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>The boundary between the two layers, with an outer layer of higher reflective index, ensures that the fiber as a whole acts as a wave guide, with minimal losses of light as it bounces down the fiber. Therefore, optical fibers are much better than wires for transmitting data over long distances. They can also achieve staggering bandwidths, being immune to the induction and capacitive problems associated with wire. As such, they are heavily employed in the telecom industry, especially for high-bandwidth “pipes” between cities and also as submarine cables. It is becoming more and more common for fiber to replace copper in the final mile of telecom connections, actually terminating in homes to provide very high-speed Internet and cable TV.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>As <a href="#filepos1951846">Fig. 5.34</a> implies, light will follow various paths through the fiber, and these paths will be of different lengths, limiting the effective bandwidth. This effect will reduce as the diameter of the internal core reduces. Taken to its limit, a single-mode fiber has a core of between 8 μm and 10.5 μm, and a cladding material diameter of 125 μm. This can be thought of as allowing only the straight-through path of light shown in <a href="#filepos1951846">Fig. 5.34</a>. These fibers can achieve bandwidths in the order of 50 Gb/s over hundreds of miles.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Data are sent using a light source at the sending end (LED or laser diode) and a photodiode or transistor at the other end. Laser diodes are used in telecom systems because the coherent light that they produce travels better, but LEDs are also used in low-cost systems, such as fiber-based audio links in consumer digital audio systems.</span></div>  <div class="mbppagebreak"></div><div id="filepos1954140" class="calibre8"><span><a></a><span class="bold">CHAPTER 6</span></span></div><div class="calibre32"> </div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>Sensors are devices that measure a physical property, such as temperature, humidity, stress, and so on. As this is an electronics book, we are concerned with converting such measurements into electrical signals. We have also stretched the definition of a sensor a little to include things such as global positioning systems (GPSs) that locate your position in space.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Many sensors will provide an output signal that is simply a voltage proportional to the property being measured. Others are digital devices that provide digital data about the property. In both cases, these measurements will often be the input to a microcontroller.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1955195" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre7"><span><span class="bold">6.1   General Principals</span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00007.jpg" class="calibre36"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Before we look at some of the vast array of sensors that are available, we will cover some of the general principles that underpin all sensing.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1955738" class="calibre48"><span class="bold"><span class="italic"><span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">6.1.1   Precision, Accuracy, and Resolution</span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>When looking at a sensor, it is important to understand the difference between precision and accuracy, particularly as precision often gives a misleading impression of the accuracy of the sensor. A classic example of this is with digital weighting scales. These may confidently tell you that you weigh 85.7 kilograms when you actually weigh 92.1 kilograms. This is only an error of 10 percent or so, and may not matter if you always use the same scales, but as an absolute measurement, it might be well off the mark.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>So precision is a matter of the number of digits reported by the sensor. For an analog sensor, the readings are continuous.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>When it comes to digital sensors, there will be a number of bits of resolution. That might be 8 bits (1 in 256), 12 bits (1 in 4096), or higher; that is, the reading is no longer continuous, but has been quantized.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01279.jpg" class="calibre1159"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 6.1   Sensor types</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div id="filepos1957349" class="calibre3"><span class="bold"><span class="italic"><span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">6.1.2   The Observer Effect</span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>The observer effect states that the act of observing a property changes it. This is the case in a car tire, for example. When you measure the pressure with a conventional tire gauge, you will let a little of the air out, thus changing the pressure that you are measuring. For most sensors, this change will have a negligible effect, but it is something worth keeping at the back of your mind when deciding whether you are getting a true reading.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1958047" class="calibre48"><span class="bold"><span class="italic"><span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">6.1.3   Calibration</span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>If your invention is a low-cost consumer item that will be mass-produced, then it will be much cheaper and easier to produce if there is no calibration to do. In fact, individual calibration to take differences in individual sensors into account is likely to be prohibitively expensive.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span><a></a><img alt="image" src="images/01280.jpg" class="calibre1160"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 6.2   Sensors</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>If, on the other hand, your invention is specialized, high-value equipment, then individual calibration of sensors is possible.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>The principal of calibration is the same whatever property the sensor measures. The idea is that you take a number of readings from the sensor of unknown accuracy while the sensor is measuring a standard value of known accuracy. So, to calibrate a temperature sensor, your accurate standard might be boiling distilled water at 100°C, or more likely, the temperature in a highly accurate oven constructed for the purpose of calibrating the sensor. This oven will itself need to have been calibrated against an even more accurate standard.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>When you have discovered the degree to which your sensor deviates from the standard, then you can compensate for it in some way. Since the sensor will almost certainly be supplying information to a microcontroller, a common way to make the calibration is to change the values in a lookup table. This table contains accurate values against raw values. For example, the raw value straight from a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter is a number between 0 and 1023. These numbers, perhaps in increments of 5, might be the left-hand side of the table, with the right-hand side of the table containing the equivalent temperature as a decimal in degrees Celsius. Interpolation can be used in the gaps between the raw readings by assuming that the small segment of the curve is linear (see <a href="#filepos1960655">Fig. 6.3</a>).</span></div>

<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 6.3   Actual reading against raw value for a fictional sensor</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Some IC sensors are actually calibrated individually during the manufacturing process, with the values for the lookup table being written into the read-only memory (ROM) of the sensor. This allows accurate sensing at low cost.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span><img alt="image" src="images/00007.jpg" class="calibre36"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Temperature sensors are one of the most common types of sensors. Computers and many types of equipment will sense their own temperature to prevent overheating. In addition, as well as electronic thermometers, there are thermostats that keep temperature constant by controlling the power to a load, usually just turning it on and off. <a href="#filepos1962128">Figure 6.4</a> shows a variety of temperature sensors.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>The term “thermistor” is a combination of the words “thermal” and “resistor.” A thermistor is a resistor whose resistance changes markedly with temperature. Thermistors come in two flavors: negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and positive temperature coefficient (PTC). An NTC thermistor’s resistance will decrease with increasing temperature, and a PTC thermistor will behave the opposite way, with the resistance increasing as temperature increases. The NTC is the more common type.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>The relationship between temperature and resistance in a thermocouple is not a linear one. Even over relatively short temperature ranges—say 0 to 100°C, a linear approximation will introduce considerable errors (see <a href="#filepos1963590">Fig. 6.5</a>).</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>The Steinhart-Hart equation is a third-order approximation used to determine the temperature as a function of the thermistor’s resistance. It works for both NTC and PTC devices. It is normally stated as:</span></div>
<div class="calibre19"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01284.jpg" class="calibre1164"/></span></div>

The manufacturer of a thermistor will give all three constant values.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>An alternative and more common model for this relationship uses a single parameter (<span class="italic">Beta</span>) and assumes constants of <span class="italic">T</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">0</span></small></sub> and <span class="italic">R</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">0</span></small></sub>, where <span class="italic">T</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">0</span></small></sub> is usually 25°C and <span class="italic">R</span><sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">0</span></small></sub> is the resistance of the thermistor at that temperature.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>While thermistors are good for measuring relatively small ranges in temperature—typically –40 to +125°C, for much higher temperatures and temperature ranges, thermocouples are used (see <a href="#filepos1970934">Fig. 6.7</a>).</span></div>
<div id="filepos1970934" class="calibre3"><span><a></a><img alt="image" src="images/01294.jpg" class="calibre1174"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 6.7   Thermocouples</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Any conductor subjected to a thermal gradient will experience something called the Seebeck effect; that is, it will generate a small voltage. The magnitude of this voltage is dependent on the type of metal, so if two different metals are joined, the temperature of that junction can be measured by measuring the voltage across the metal leads, at the far end from the junction. It is also necessary to measure the temperature at the other end of the thermocouple leads (often using a thermistor, since this will probably be at room temperature). This second temperature is called the “cold-junction” temperature.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Lookup tables are often used to calculate the absolute temperature at the junction, based on the voltage and the cold-junction temperature, as the relationship is not completely linear and needs a fifth-order polynomial to model it accurately. Manufacturer’s data sheets for thermocouples will normally contain large tables for calculating the temperature.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>The most commonly used metals for a thermocouple are the alloys chromel (90 percent nickel and 10 percent chromium) and alumel (95 percent nickel, 2 percent manganese, 2 percent aluminum, and 1 percent silicon). A thermocouple made with these materials will typically be able to measure temperatures over the range –200°C to +1350°C. The sensitivity is 41 μV / °C for these metals.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1972927" class="calibre48"><span class="bold"><span class="italic"><span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">6.2.3   Resistive Temperature Detectors</span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div class="calibre11"><span>Resistive temperature detectors (RTDs) are perhaps the simplest temperature sensors to understand. Like thermistors, RTDs rely on their resistance changing with temperature. However, rather than use a special material that is sensitive to temperature changes (like a thermistor), they simply use a coil of wire (normally platinum) around a glass or ceramic core. The resistance of the core is often contrived to be 100 Ω at 0°C.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>RTDs are much less sensitive than thermistors and can therefore be used over a much wider range of temperatures. The resistance of platinum changes in a relatively linear manner, and can be assumed to be linear for a range of 100°C or so. For the range 0 to 100°C, the resistance of a platinum RTD will vary by 0.003925 Ω/Ω/°C.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>So, a 100 Ω (at 0°C) platinum RTD will, at a temperature of 100°C, have a resistance of:</span></div>
<div class="calibre30"><span>100Ω + 100°C × 100 Ω × 0.003925 Ω/Ω/°C = 139.25 Ω</span></div>
<div class="calibre30"><span>The first 100 Ω in the equation above is for the base resistance of the RTD at 0°C.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>This can be arranged in a potential divider in the same way as a thermistor.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>An alternative to using a thermistor and fixed-value resistor in a potential divider arrangement is to use a special-purpose temperature measurement IC.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Devices such as the TMP36 come in a three-pin package and are used as shown in <a href="#filepos1975458">Fig. 6.8</a>.</span></div>
<div id="filepos1975458" class="calibre3"><span><a></a><img alt="image" src="images/01295.jpg" class="calibre1175"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 6.8   TMP36 temperature sensor</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Unlike a thermistor, the sensor’s output voltage is almost linear at 10 mV / °C for a temperature range of –40 to +125°C. The accuracy is only ±2°C over the temperature range.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>The temperature in °C is simply calculated from V<sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">out</span></small></sub> using the formula:</span></div>
<div class="calibre19"><span>T = 100V<sub class="calibre37"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">out</span></small></sub> – 50</span></div>
<div class="calibre30"><span>The constant 50 is specified in the data sheet for the TMP36.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>These devices are considerably more expensive than thermistors and series resistors, but they are very easy and convenient to use.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>An even higher technology approach to temperature measurement is to use a digital thermometer IC. These devices have a serial interface for use by microcontrollers.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>A typical digital thermometer IC is the DS18B20. It uses a serial bus standard called 1-Wire that can allow multiple sensors to share the same data line (see <a href="#filepos1977548">Fig. 6.9</a>).</span></div>
<div id="filepos1977548" class="calibre3"><span><img alt="image" src="images/01296.jpg" class="calibre1176"/></span></div>
<div class="calibre34"><span class="calibre17"><span class="bold"><span>FIGURE 6.9   DS18B20 temperature sensor IC</span></span></span></div><div class="calibre35"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>These devices are more accurate than the linear devices such as the TMP36. The digital thermometer IC has a stated accuracy of ±0.5°C and a temperature range of –55°C to +125°C.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>Since digital thermometer ICs transmit their data digitally, they are very suitable for remote sensing, as lead length and electrical interference will have less effect than with an analog device. In fact, they will either work accurately or not at all in an electrically noisy environment.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Digital thermometer ICs can also be configured to work in “parasitic” power mode, where they harvest power from the data line, allowing them to be connected with just two wires. The GND and positive supply to the DS18B20 are both grounded, and the microcontroller must control a MOSFET transistor that pulls the data line up to the supply voltage under strict timing conditions.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>If you have been to the doctor recently and have had your temperature taken, you will probably have seen an infrared thermometer that is placed near your ear and measures the temperature just on the inside surface of the ear without any actual contact. The ear is chosen because it is effectively a hole into the body that is free from the influence of external radiation, so that the back surface of the ear acts as a “black-body” radiator.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Pyrometers, or more specifically, broadband pyrometers, measure the radiation intensity, which has dimensions of energy per second per unit of area and use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to determine the temperature:</span></div>
<div class="calibre19"><span><span class="italic">j*</span> = σ<span class="italic">T</span><sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">4</span></small></sup></span></div>
<div class="calibre30"><span>The radiation intensity (<span class="italic">j</span>*) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.6704 × 10<sup class="calibre29"><small class="calibre28"><span class="calibre17">–8</span></small></sup>

<div class="calibre26"><span>These devices use an infrared sensor such as the MLX90614 coupled with optics that focus the infrared radiation from the subject onto the sensor. When used for other measurement applications, the infrared thermometer will often have a low-power laser align with the sensor so that it can be aimed to take spot readings of temperature.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Devices such as the MLX90614 are more than just a sensor, containing a low-noise amplifier, high-precision analog-to-digital converter, and all the associated electronics to produce a digital output.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>As with other IC sensors, the advantages of including all the electronics in the same package as the sensor itself are the reduction of noise and simplicity of interfacing.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Other sensors are available for high temperatures, such as those found in industrial furnaces, and the term “pyrometer,” with its overtones of fire, is usually reserved for such high-temperature applications.</span></div>

<div class="calibre30"><span>The figures for accuracy in <a href="#filepos1982910">Table 6.1</a> are somewhat arbitrary, as for most sensors, high accuracy can be obtained by individual calibration. It is also the accuracy of the overall system—including the electronics that use the sensor value—that counts.

<div class="calibre11"><span>Touch screens are commonly used in cellular phones and tablet computers. There are many different technologies used in touch screens. The most commonly used are resistive touch screens.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span><a></a>Resistive touch screens are one of the older and more readily used touch screen technologies. They rely on a transparent sheet on top of the display. This sheet is flexible and also conductive. <a href="#filepos1985388">Figure 6.11</a> shows a typical arrangement for a four-wire resistive touch screen.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>Both the top and bottom surfaces are coated with a conductive layer. Insulating dots are evenly sprayed onto the rigid bottom surface to keep the layers apart, except when they are pressed together.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>To determine the X position of a touch, A is set to 0 V and B to 5 V, establishing a voltage gradient across the top surface. The voltage measured at C, or for that matter D, will be proportional to the X position. This is converted into coordinates using an analog-to-digital converter.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>The conductive layer acts just like a potentiometer with C as the slider. If the device measuring the voltage at C has a very high input impedance, then the resistance of the track from the surface to the terminal C can be ignored. Most microcontrollers will have an analog-to-digital converter with a high input resistance, typically several MΩ. So, the voltage at C will be between 0 and 5 V in direct proportion to the distance from A of the touch.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>When it comes to reading the Y position, some crafty footwork has to take place. Now C will be set to 0V, D to 5V, and the voltage measured at A or B.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>All this processing will be carried out by either a special-purpose controller chip or a microcontroller.</span></div>

<div class="calibre11"><span>Ultrasonic distance-measuring devices are much loved by the developers of hobby robots. They are also found in commercial equivalents to the tape measure.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>These devices send out a pulse of ultrasound and time how long it takes for the reflection to come back. A simple calculation involving the speed of sound will determine the distance to the object (see <a href="#filepos1988093">Fig. 6.12</a>).</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span>These devices have a measurement range of up to around 5 meters (15 ft), but this depends very much on the size and sound reflecting properties of the object. They also suffer limits of accuracy due to variations in the speed of sound, which is dependent on many factors, including atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature. For example, at 0°C, the speed of sound in dry air is 331 meters/seconds, but this rises to 346 meters/second at 25°C—a difference of 4.5 percent.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span>Sometimes separate transducers are used for sending and receiving the pulses of ultrasound, and sometimes a single transducer is used in both roles.</span></div>
