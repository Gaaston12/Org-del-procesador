<p class="calibre_1"><span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> rattled around in my head for about a decade before I started writing it. As I was contemplating <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> and then writing it, and even after the book was published, people would ask me, "What's the book about?" </p>
<p class="calibre_1">I was always reluctant to answer this question. I'd mumble something about "a unique journey through the evolution of the digital technologies that define the modern age" and hope that would be sufficient. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">But finally I had to admit it: "<span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> is a book about how computers work." </p>
<p class="calibre_1">As I feared, the reactions weren't favorable. "Oh, I have a book like that," some people would say, to which my immediate response was, "No, no, no, you don't have a book like this one." I still think that's true. <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> is not like other how-computers-work books. It doesn't have big color illustrations of disk drives with arrows showing how the data sweeps into the computer. <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> has no drawings of trains carrying a cargo of zeros and ones. Metaphors and similes are wonderful literary devices but they do nothing but obscure the beauty of technology. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">The other comment I heard was, "People don't want to know how computers work." And this I'm sure is true. I personally happen to enjoy learning how things work. But I also like to choose which things I learn about and which I do not. I'd be hard pressed to explain how my refrigerator works, for example. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">Yet I often hear people ask questions that reveal a need to know something about the inner workings of personal computers. One such common question is, "What's the difference between storage and memory?" </p>
<p class="calibre_1">That's certainly a critical question. The marketing of personal computers is based on such concepts. Even novice users are expected to know how many <span><em class="italic">megas</em></span> of the one thing and <span><em class="italic">gigas</em></span> of the other thing will be necessary for their particular applications. Novice users are also expected to master the concept of the computer "file" and to visualize how files are loaded from storage into memory and saved from memory back to storage. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">The storage-and-memory question is usually answered with an analogy: "Memory is like the surface of your desk and storage is like the filing cabinet." That's not a bad answer as far as it goes. But I find it quite unsatisfactory. It makes it sound as if computer architecture were patterned after an office. The truth is that the distinction between memory and storage is an artificial one and exists solely because we don't have a single storage medium that is both fast and vast as well as nonvolatile. What we know today as "von Neumann architecture"—the dominant computer architecture for over 50 years—is a direct result of this technical deficiency. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">Here's another question that someone once asked me: "Why can't you run Macintosh programs under Windows?" My mouth opened to begin an answer when I realized that it involved many more technical issues than I'm sure my questioner was prepared to deal with in one sitting. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">I want <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> to be a book that makes you understand these things, not in some abstract way, but with a depth that just might even rival that of electrical engineers and programmers. I also hope that you might recognize the computer to be one of the crowning achievements of twentieth century technology and appreciate it as a beautiful thing in itself without metaphors and similes getting in the way. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">Computers are constructed in a hierarchy, from transistors down at the bottom to the information displayed on our computer screens at the top. Moving up each level in the hierarchy—which is how <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> is structured—is probably not as hard as most people might think. There is certainly a lot going on inside the modern computer, but it is a lot of very common and simple operations. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">Although computers today are more complex than the computers of 25 years or 50 years ago, they are still fundamentally the same. That's what's so great about studying the history of technology: The further back in time you go, the simpler the technologies become. Thus it's possible to reach a point where it all makes relatively easy sense. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">In <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span>, I went as far back as I could go. Astonishingly, I found that I could go back into the nineteenth century and use early telegraph equipment to show how computers are built. In theory at least, everything in the first 17 chapters of <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> can be built entirely using simple electrical devices that have been around for over a century. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">This use of antique technology gives <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> a fairly nostalgic feel, I think. <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> is a book that could never be titled <em class="italic">The Faster New Faster Thing</em> or <em class="italic">Business @ the Speed of a Digital Nervous System</em>. The "bit" isn't defined until page 68; "byte" isn't defined until page 180. I don't mention transistors until page 142, and that's only in passing. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">So, while <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> goes fairly deep into the workings of the computer (few other books show how computer processors actually work, for example), the pace is fairly relaxed. Despite the depth, I tried to make the trip as comfortable as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre_1">But without little drawings of trains carrying a cargo of zeros and ones.</p>
