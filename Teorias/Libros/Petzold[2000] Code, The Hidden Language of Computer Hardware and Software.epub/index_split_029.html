<p class="calibre_1"><span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> was conceived in 1987. It rattled around in my head for nearly a decade and was finally committed to a Microsoft Word file between January 1996 and July 1999. I offer many thanks: </p>
<p class="calibre_1">to the readers of early drafts of <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> who contributed comments, criticisms, and suggestions: Sheryl Canter, Jan Eastlund, Peter Goldeman, Lynn Magalska, and Deirdre Sinnott; </p>
<p class="calibre_1">to my agent, Claudette Moore of Moore Literary Agency, and to everyone at Microsoft Press who helped make <span><em class="italic">Code</em></span> a reality, particularly those whose names are listed on the copyright page of this book and on the colophon, following the index; </p>
<p class="calibre_1">to my mother, who never held me back;</p>
<p class="calibre_1">to Little Cat, who shared my apartment with me from 1982 through May 1999, and who inspired many cat references in my writing;</p>
<p class="calibre_1">to Web sites such as Bibliofind (<a href="http://www.bibliofind.com" shape="rect">www.bibliofind.com</a>) and Advanced Book Exchange (<a href="http://www.abebooks.com" shape="rect">www.abebooks.com</a>) that offer convenient access to used books, and to the staff of the Science, Industry, and Business Library (SIBL) branch of the New York Public Library (<a href="http://www.nypl.org" shape="rect">www.nypl.org</a>); </p>
<p class="calibre_1">to my friends in the rooms, without whose support none of this would be possible;</p>
<p class="calibre_1">and again to Deirdre, my ideal reader and so much more.</p>
